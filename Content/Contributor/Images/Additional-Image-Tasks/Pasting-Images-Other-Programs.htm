        <p>You can copy and paste an image from another program, such as Microsoft Word, into a document. </p>
        <div class="tip">
            <p class="Tip-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed420;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Before copying an image from another application, you should set its size to 100%. This enables you to resize the image later within <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> without loss of quality. On the other hand, let's say you resized the image to 50% in Microsoft Word and then pasted the image into <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. Later, you decide to enlarge the image in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. But in the output the quality does not look very good because it was necessary to add pixels.</p>

        <h2>How to Paste Images From Other Programs</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>After copying the image in the other program, open a <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/Co-Fl/General/Content-File-Document.flsnp" /> in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</li>
            <li>Place your cursor where you want to paste the image.</li>
            <li>Press <span class="Emphasis">CTRL+V</span> on your keyboard.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Save Image dialog that opens, find and select the folder where you want to add the copy of the image. You can use the buttons in the local toolbar to navigate.</p>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/Co-Fl/SharePoint/Multi-View-Table5.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>In the <span class="Emphasis">File name</span> field, enter a name for the image.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. The image is added.</li>

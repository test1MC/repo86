        <p>After you connect to a SharePoint server, you can do the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check out" />(Optional) Check Out Files </span>You can check out files from the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface. Checking out a file simply means to activate a "flag" on the SharePoint site indicating that you want to access the file and prevent others from editing it and conflicting with your changes. See <MadCap:xref href="Checking-Out-SharePoint-Files.htm">Checking Out SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>If necessary, you can also undo any check outs. See <MadCap:xref href="Undoing-Check-Out-SharePoint-Files.htm">Undoing a Check-Out of SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:Edit files" />Open and Edit Files </span>You can open a file from the SharePoint Explorer by simply double-clicking it. When you do this, you are opening the actual file existing on the SharePoint site. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application. See <MadCap:xref href="Opening-SharePoint-Files.htm">Opening SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:check in" />(Optional) Check In Files </span>When you are finished working on a SharePoint file that you checked out, you can check it back in so that others can edit it. See <MadCap:xref href="Checking-In-SharePoint-Files.htm">Checking In SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>

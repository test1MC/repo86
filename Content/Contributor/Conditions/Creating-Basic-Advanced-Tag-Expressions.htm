        <p>You might create tag expressions when you are editing a document (by clicking <img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Conditions-btn3.png" alt="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> on the left side of the local toolbar in the XML Editor). Doing this would simply let you see how a document would look when certain conditions are included or excluded, or when they are associated with a particular Flare target that the author has created.</p>

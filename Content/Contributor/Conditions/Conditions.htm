        <p>If you are working with a Flare author by using the Contribution or Review workflow, you may find that conditions have been included in the files. A condition tag is a marker that can be applied to different areas of your content so that some sections show up in some outputs but not in others. Following are some of the ways you might work with conditions in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>

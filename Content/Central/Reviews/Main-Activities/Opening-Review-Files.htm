        <p>Opening files sent for reviews is quite simple, but keep in mind that there are multiple panes that you will see on the Reviews page.<![CDATA[  ]]></p>

        <h2>How to Open a File in the Editor</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the left side of the interface, click <b>Reviews</b>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>From the appropriate pane on the left, select the file:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If an author has sent the file to you for review, open the file from the <span class="Emphasis">Pending</span> pane.</li>
                    <li>If you are the original author, you can open the file from the <span class="Emphasis">Sent</span> pane. You might do this if you want to continue editing the file after you have sent it to others for review. Editing it in Central might be preferable to editing it in Flare at this point; otherwise, you would have to resolve your changes with those from reviewers when you bring the file back into Flare.</li>
                    <li>If you are a reviewer who has already submitted a completed file, you can open it from the <span class="Emphasis">Submitted</span> pane. You might do this if you remember something you wanted to edit in the file after submitting it. You will be allowed to access the file in this pane until the author closes out the review process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The file opens in the Review Editor to the right.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Reviewers can return to a file in the Pending tab repeatedly over time to make changes to it. When reviewers finish working on a file and do not need to make any further edits, they submit the file. When all reviewers assigned to the file have submitted it, the original author is informed and can then close out the review process.</p>

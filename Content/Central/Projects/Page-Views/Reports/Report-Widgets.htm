        <h2>How to Add Report Widgets</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Reports view, and in the toolbar click <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Interface/Buttons/Add-Widgets-btn.png" alt="" title="" class="ReduceButtonSize" />.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Reports/Reports22.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can click this same button in the toolbar of the Home or Projects dashboard.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p class="Tip-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed420;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">It is recommended that you use the option in the Reports view because it lets you add widgets for multiple kinds of critical reports at the same time. On the other hand, if you are on a dashboard, you will need to repeat the steps for adding each type of report, plus you will need to filter each blank widget afterward to choose a report for it.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do one of the following in the dialog that displays, depending on the method you are using:</p>
                <p class="Subheading">Method 1: Reports View (Recommended)</p>
                <p>If you clicked the button in the Reports view, select <span class="Emphasis">Home Dashboard</span>, <b>Project Dashboard</b>, or both, depending on where you want to see the widgets.</p>
                <p>Then, below those selections, choose which types of reports you want to include in widgets.</p>
                <p>After that, click <b>Add</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Reports/Reports23.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
                <p class="Subheading">Method 2: Home or Project Dashboard</p>
                <p>If you clicked the button on a dashboard, select <span class="Emphasis">Reports</span> and click <b>Add</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Reports/Reports15.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
                <p>Repeat these steps for each type of report widget you want to add to a dashboard.</p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
                <p class="Subheading">What's Next?</p>
                <p>If you used the Reports view method, you can go to the dashboard, then click and drag the widgets to move them where you want them.</p>
                <p>If you used the Dashboard method, the new widgets will initially be empty. So you will need to filter them in order to choose report types. After this, you can click and drag the widgets to move them where you want them on the dashboard.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the method you used, keep in mind that you might need to scroll down to see your new widgets if existing widgets are already taking up all the space toward the top of the dashboard.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Filter Report Widgets</h2>
        <p>If you added a widget from the Reports view, it should be populated already. But if you have an empty reports widget, use the following steps to choose a report type in order to populate it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the left side of the interface, select either <b>Home</b> or <b>Projects</b>, depending on the dashboard where you've added the report widgets. If you selected Projects, you might also need to choose <b>Dashboard</b> at the top of the interface.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the empty widget container, click <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Interface/Buttons/Settings-btn1.png" alt="" title="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the upper-right corner.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Reports/Reports16.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the menu, expand <b>Project</b> (if necessary) to choose an uploaded Flare project. Then expand <b>Report</b> and select a report type.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Reports/Reports17.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Click away from the dialog. The widget is now populated with data for that report type.</li>
        </ol>

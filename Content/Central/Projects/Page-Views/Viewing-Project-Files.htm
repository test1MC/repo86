        <p>After opening a project in Central, you can view files and commits associated with a project.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Files View</h2>
        <p>After you open a project in Central, you can click the <b>Files</b> option at the top. This lets you see a read-only view of all files in your project in a few different ways.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
        <p>After you select this option, the project files are shown on the left side of the page. You can expand or collapse the folders to locate a specific file.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
        <p>If you select a file, it opens in a <b>Preview</b> to the right.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <p>The file will not look exactly the way it does in the Flare project. Content files (e.g., topics and snippets) display in much the same way they do when viewing them in the editor on the Reviews page. Other files might only display the code.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that you cannot make changes to files on this page. You can only view them, their contents, and information about them.</p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
        <p>Depending on the type of file you open, you can switch between Preview, &lt;/code&gt;, and Commits views.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <p>Here is the <b>&lt;/code&gt;</b> view:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View5.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
        <p>Here is the <b>Commits</b> view:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Central/Projects/Files-View6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Central-Guides.Central-Projects-and-Builds-Guide" />
        <p>The Commits view lists all of the changes over time for the file, with the most recent commit at the top. If the user added a comment when committing the file, it is shown next to that user’s avatar. If the user did not add a comment, the path of the file is shown instead. For more details, see <MadCap:xref href="Viewing-Project-Commits.htm">Viewing Project Commits</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There are two buttons that you can use in this view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">View Commit </span>This opens the Commits view.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">View Diff </span>This expands to show file differences between the current version of the file and the previous version. Click the button again to collapse the differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Closed Review Files</h1>
        <p>A Flare author can close the review process for a file at any time, even while someone has it open and has not yet submitted changes. If this occurs, the file can no longer be edited on Central. You can contact the author to determine why the file was closed, and you may need to request that the author re-send it for review so that you can finish editing and/or commenting on it.</p>

            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>You have created two profiles—ProfileA and ProfileB.</p>
            <p>Suppose that some of the settings for Profile A are: red border, scale background to a setting of .8, and a shade factor of 3. On the other hand, the only unique setting for ProfileB is torn edges on each side.</p>
            <p>If you initially use ProfileA when you capture an image, that image will automatically have the qualities associated with that profile (i.e., red border, scaled to a setting of .8, and shade factor of 3). Later, perhaps you change your mind and want to use the settings from ProfileB for that image. Instead of recapturing the image, you can simply apply ProfileB to the image. That way, you do not need to manually remove the old settings and specify the torn edges. When you apply the profile to the image, all of the settings are changed automatically.</p>

            <p>You have created hundreds of images and inserted them into a MadCap Flare project. Later, you might decide that you want all of those images to have a 1-pixel black border. Rather than opening each image and adding the border manually, you can add a profile with border settings, create a batch, and choose to apply that profile to the images in your folder. </p>

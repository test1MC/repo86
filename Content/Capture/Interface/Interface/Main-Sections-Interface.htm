        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> user interface consists of the following major sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Top </span>The top portion of the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface displays either a ribbon view, or a tool strip view, which are used to access features.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Left </span> The left side of the Capture interface is the default location for many different <MadCap:keyword term="Window panes;Workspace:window panes" />window panes (e.g., Palettes window pane, Help TOC window pane, Help Index window pane).

The Capture Editor is the most important area of the interface. It displays a captured image, which you can modify. This middle section also displays the Start Page, which is used for quickly performing high-level tasks and accessing information.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Right </span>The right side of the Capture interface is the default location for Dynamic Help<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">, which automatically displays the most appropriate online Help topic for whichever area of the interface is currently active</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Bottom </span>The bottom of the Capture interface is the default location for the Object Layers and Messages window panes.</li>
        </ul>

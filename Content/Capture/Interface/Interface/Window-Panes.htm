        <p>Capture has numerous window panes in the interface that are used for a variety of purposes, such as using palettes or viewing online Help elements (e.g., TOC, index). Some of these panes are located by default on the left side of the workspace (e.g., Palettes window, Help TOC), other panes are located on the right side (e.g., Dynamic Help), and still others are located at the bottom (e.g., Messages window). If more than one window pane is open on either side, the panes are organized in an accordion structure. This means that they are stacked on top of each other, with the active window pane displayed "in front" of the other panes. Accordion bars for each window pane are located at the bottom, and you can click any bar to bring that particular window pane "in front" so that you can work in it.</p>

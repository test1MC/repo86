            <MadCap:keyword term="Spell check;Images:spell check" />Spell Checking Images</h1>
        <p>This is a feature that lets you perform spell checking for the current image, all open images, or all images in the same folder as the current one. As questionable words are identified, you can select an alternative spelling, ignore the spelling warning, and add words to the dictionary so that future occurrences are not flagged as possible misspellings.</p>
        <h2>How to Spell Check Images</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the image.</li>
            <li>Select  <span class="Emphasis">Edit &gt; Check Spelling</span> or press<span class="Emphasis"> F7 </span>on your keyboard.</li>
            <li>Click the down arrow next to the <span class="Emphasis">Start Spell Check</span> field and select one of the following:<ul><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">current document</span> Capture checks the spelling in the active file only.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">all open documents</span> Capture checks the spelling in all files currently open in the interface.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">documents in same folder</span> Capture checks the spelling in all files located in the same folder. </li></ul></li>
            <p>If you want to skip searching in the current file and move on to the next file, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Al-Ca-Co-Fl-Li-Mi/Interface/Buttons/Double-Right-Arrow-Search-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. </p>
            <li>After Capture finds and highlights the first questionable word, a list of suggested spellings is displayed at the bottom of the Spell Check Window. If you want to change the spelling of the term, follow step 5. If you do not want to change the spelling of the word, follow step 6.</li>
            <li>You can type your own corrected word in the <span class="Emphasis"><MadCap:keyword term="Suggestions" />Suggestions</span> field or you can select a word from the list (which is then automatically added to the Suggestions field). Then click one of the following buttons.<ul><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Changes" />Change</span>  Capture changes only that occurrence of the misspelled word.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Change in All Files </span>Capture changes that occurrence of the misspelled word, as well as any other occurrences of it in the rest of the files.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If you want to keep the word as it is, click one of the following buttons.<ul><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Skip</span> Capture ignores the spelling of the word (this occurrence only) and moves on to the next misspelled word. If other occurrences of the word are found, they will be flagged as questionable spellings.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Dictionaries:adding to" />Add to Dictionary </span>Capture adds the word to the dictionary so that it is not flagged as a questionable spelling in the future. Capture then moves on to the next misspelled word.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Ignore </span>Capture ignores the spelling of the word and moves on to the next misspelled word. Capture also adds the spelling of this word to the Ignored Words dialog (for this image only). This means that if other occurrences of the word are found in the image, they will not be flagged as questionable spellings.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Ignore in All Files </span>Capture ignores the spelling of the word and moves on to the next misspelled word. Capture also adds the spelling of this word to the Ignored Words dialog (for all images included in the search). This means that if other occurrences of the word are found in any other images included in the search, they will not be flagged as questionable spellings.</li></ul></li>

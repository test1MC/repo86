            <MadCap:keyword term="Images:saving;Saving:images" />Saving an Image</h1>
        <p>After capturing and editing an image, the final step is to save the image. You can save images using any of the following file types: <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Capture/File-Format/File-Types-Supported.flsnp" />.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/Print-Output/Chapter-Discusses-Following.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Capture-Guides.Capture-Getting-Started-Guide" />

        <h2>Save</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis"> File &gt; Save</span> or press <span class="Emphasis">CTRL+S</span> on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>This saves the changes in the active file. If the file has not been saved previously, the Save As dialog opens. Complete the options (destination, file name, file type) in that dialog and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</p>
        <h2>Rename and Save</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Rename and Save</span>.</p>
        <p>This saves the active file under a different name and/or file type and to a particular location. The difference between this option and the normal "Save As" option is what happens to the original file. If you use this option, the old file is simply replaced with the new name. If you use the "Save As" option, the file is saved with a new name, but the old file still exists with the old name.</p>
        <h2>Save As&#160;</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save As</span>.</p>
        <p>This opens the Save As dialog, which lets you save the active file under a different name and/or file type and to a particular location. Complete the options (destination, file name, file type) in that dialog and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. The new file is then displayed in the editor.</p>
        <h2>Save To</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save To</span>.</p>
        <p>This opens the Save As dialog, which lets you save the active file under a different name and/or file type and to a particular location. Complete the options (destination, file name, file type) in that dialog and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. The new file is not automatically displayed in the editor.</p>
        <h2>Save All</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save All</span> or press <span class="Emphasis">CTRL+SHIFT+S</span> on your keyboard.</p>
        <h2>Save Print Version</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save Print Version</span>.</p>
        <p>This saves a copy of the image with print settings applied to it. This option is enabled if you have an image open in the Capture Editor and you have previously applied print settings to that image. (You must also save the image before this option is enabled.) Print settings are applied to an image on the Format tab of the File Properties dialog or Profiles Editor. When you use this option, a copy of the image is saved in a folder called "PrintVersions," next to the location where the original image was saved. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Interface/Editors/Capture-Editor.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Capture Editor</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../Interface/Dialogs/File-Properties-Dialog.htm" target="" title="" alt="">File Properties Dialog</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../Interface/Editors/Profiles-Editor.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Profiles Editor</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../Single-Source-Images/Setting-Image-Properties-Using-Mediums.htm">Setting Image Properties Using Mediums</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h2>Save to Targets</h2>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save To Targets</span>.</p>
        <p>Place check marks next to the profiles that you want to use, and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</p>
        <p>If you want to use the same image with more than one profile, you can save the image to multiple profile targets. This option works especially well if you have included condition tags on some objects in the image. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Conditions/Conditions.htm">Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2>Tips for Saving Images</h2>
        <p>Here are some tips that you might find useful when saving an image in Capture.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Profiles:about" />Use a Profile</span> If you use a profile when capturing an image, it will save you time. A profile lets you apply various settings to an image as you capture it. This includes selecting a destination, file type, and even a file name ahead of time. Then, when you save the image, that information will already be completed for you in the Save As dialog. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Profiles/Profiles.htm">Profiles</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="MadCap Flare:integration with Capture" />Save in a Flare Project</span> If you plan to use the Capture image in a MadCap Flare project, it is a good idea to save the image in the Content &gt; Resources &gt; Images subfolder (the default image location) where you have stored the Flare project. This way, you do not have to add the image to the project before inserting it into a topic. In addition, each time you make changes to the image in Capture, those changes will automatically be reflected in the Flare project.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Access Capture from Flare</span> Initiate the screen capture from within Flare. When you do this, the image will be saved within the Flare project. See the online Help in Flare for more information about its tight integration with Capture.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Conditions:targets" />Use Condition Tags and Save to Profile Targets</span> If you are saving an image to multiple profile targets, you might try placing condition tags on objects within the image (e.g., one copy of the image might be set to include certain objects and another copy of the image might be set to exclude those objects). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Conditions/Conditions.htm">Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">— Save to Targets</p>
            <p>Let's say you have a profile called "Profile1" that specifies images should have a 3-pixel black border around it. You might have another profile called "Profile2," which is identical to the other profile, except that it specifies images should not have any border.</p>
            <p>With those profiles already created, you can capture a new image. When you are ready to save the image, instead of clicking the usual Save button, you select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save &gt; Save To Targets</span> (ribbon) or <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Save To Targets</span> (menu). And this is what you see:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Capture/Conditions/Save-To-Targets7.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Because you want that one image to use settings from both Profile1 and Profile2, you place check marks next to those profiles and save.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Capture/Conditions/Save-To-Targets8.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>The end result is that one copy of the image has a border and the other copy does not.</p>

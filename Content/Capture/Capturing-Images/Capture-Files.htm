        <p>When you use Capture to create images, two types of files are at work: image files and property files.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Files:image;Images:files" />Image Files</h2>
        <p>An image file is the main file created when you capture and save an image. You can create and open images using any of the following file types: <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Capture/File-Format/File-Types-Supported.flsnp" />.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Files:property" />Property Files</h2>
        <p>In addition to the main image file, Capture creates an <MadCap:keyword term="XML" />XML-based file with a <MadCap:keyword term="PROPS file" />.props extension. This file holds all of the property information (including object layer information). Therefore, the objects are not merged into the image, which means that you can easily change the object information later without having to start over from scratch. It also means that the XML files can be opened and modified with third-party tools. This is especially useful if you need to localize the callouts in your images (e.g., have them translated into other languages).</p>

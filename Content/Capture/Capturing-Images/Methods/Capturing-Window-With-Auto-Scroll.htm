        <p>Use this method to capture an open window that is too long to be displayed in its entirety on the screen. This method grabs an image of the window, automatically scrolling to the bottom of the window for you. The image starts from the top edge of the window that can be seen on the screen and scrolls to the bottom to capture the image.</p>

        <h2>How to Capture a Window With Auto-Scroll</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the window that you want to capture. When you initiate this method of capture, the Capture window will be minimized, allowing you to "grab" an image of whatever is directly behind it.</li>

                <p>Capture minimizes and a red border surrounds each window  as you move the cursor over it.</p>

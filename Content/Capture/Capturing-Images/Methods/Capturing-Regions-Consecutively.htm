        <p>Use this method to capture consecutive rectangular regions of your computer screen. You can draw a rectangle over any area of your computer screen and capture that region. That image is then loaded into the Capture Editor, while the capture region rectangle and  the task bar remain on the screen. This lets you relocate and resize the  next capture region, as well as manipulate the onscreen content that you want to capture in between consecutive captures without having to select the option to capture a region each time. This method is useful when you want to capture only a specific area in multiple applications or in different areas on the screen. </p>

        <h2>How to Capture Consecutive Regions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the window(s) with regions that you want to capture and/or arrange your desktop as needed. When you initiate a region capture, the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> application will be minimized, allowing you to capture a region for whatever is directly behind it. After each capture, you can rearrange your desktop as needed.</li>

            </li>
            <li>&#160;Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Capture &gt; Capture Regions Consecutively</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Edit &gt; Capture &gt; Capture Regions Consecutively</span>.</li>
            <p>The Capture Editor is minimized and a rectangle with a red border appears on your screen, along with a task bar.</p>

            <li>
                <p>(Optional) Adjust the capture region by doing one of the following.  As you move the cursor, the task bar displays the vertical and horizontal position of the cursor (in pixels) on the screen.</p>

            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/Print-Output/Empty-Page-Break-After.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Capture-Guides.Capture-Creating-Images-Guide" />
            <li>
                <p>To capture the region, click the red capture button on the task bar.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Ca-Co-Fl/Images/Task-Bar-Capture2.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>The image is captured and loaded into the Capture Editor. The rectangle with a red border and the task bar remain onscreen so that you can capture another region.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>Rearrange your desktop as necessary, then repeat steps 4 and 5 to capture more regions. When you have finished capturing all the regions that you need, click the <span class="Emphasis">X</span> on the upper right corner of the task bar to maximize the Capture Editor and view the captured regions.</li>

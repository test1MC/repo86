        <h1>Capture Options</h1>
        <p>There are multiple options that you can use when capturing images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Shortcut Keys</span> Open the application that you want to include in the image and press the appropriate shortcut keys on your keyboard to initiate an image capture. </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">File and Edit Ribbons</span> Click the red capture button to initiate an image capture region, or use the Capture drop-down to select a capture method first.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Flare Interface</span> If you are working on a project in MadCap Flare and want to capture and insert an image, you can initiate some types of image captures (e.g., Application, Region, UI Element) from within Flare.</li>
        </ul>

However, you also have the option of delaying the capture for a certain number of seconds. See <MadCap:xref href="Features/Enabling-Time-Delay.htm">Enabling the Time Delay Feature</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <p>The most flexible method is to select a certain block of content in a topic and tag it as micro content, thereby creating a link from that specific content to a new phrase.</p>
        <p>Before we do that, let's remove a micro content phrase, and redo it using this method.</p>

        <h2>How to Create a Response by Linking From a Topic</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <span class="Emphasis">Attractions.htm</span> topic.</li>
            <li>Scroll down to the <span class="Emphasis">Zilker Park</span> heading.</li>
            <li>We don't need the bookmark that was automatically created next to the heading, so delete it.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Zilker Park</span> heading, as well as the paragraph and image below it. </p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, and click <span class="Emphasis">Create Micro Content</span>. The Create Micro Content dialog opens.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Phrase</span> field enter <span class="TypedEntry">zilker park</span>, then click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>. The Micro Content Editor opens, showing the new phrase and the linked response.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content18.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>Go back to the <span class="Emphasis">Attractions.htm</span> topic. Notice that the selected content has been wrapped inside a new micro content tag, as indicated by the structure bars on the left. This is how Flare knows exactly what to display as micro content in the search results. Also, light gray marker brackets are shown around the micro content, similar to a snippet (however, if you want to edit the content, you simply click in it and make your changes, unlike a snippet, which is a separate file).</p>

            </li>
            <li>Build and view the output again.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>Search for <span class="TypedEntry">Zilker</span>. The micro content displays in the search results. Like the previous method, you will see an automatic link to that specific content in the topic, and the response is truncated because of its height.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content20.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak />
                <p>When you expand the response, you will see that only the Zilker Park content is included.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content21.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>

                    <p class="Tip-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">In a situation such as this, you might prefer to structure the content a bit differently, perhaps with the image on one side or the other of the text. Flare lets you do this in various ways. One solution is to create a responsive layout, which will adjust the structure when the micro content is seen on devices of different sizes. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Responsive-Design/Responsive-Layouts.htm">Responsive Layouts</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

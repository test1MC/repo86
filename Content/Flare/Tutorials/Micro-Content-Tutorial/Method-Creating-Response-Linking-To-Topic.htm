            <MadCap:concept term="FilterIntroduction" />Creating a Response by Linking to a Topic</h1>
        <p>Let's alter our first micro content phrase/response by linking the phrase to a topic.</p>
        <h2>How to Create a Response by Linking to a Topic</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the left side of the Micro Content Editor, double-click the <span class="Emphasis">Music</span> phrase. The row expands, showing information below it. You will see "Add Link," followed by the text "Tell me about micro content."</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content5.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
                <p>The phrase at the bottom is called an "alternate phrase," which was already part of the original "Micro Content" phrase that we replaced earlier. We can delete this second phrase, but let's just replace it with something else that has to do with music.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the alternate phrase and press <span class="Emphasis">F2</span> on your keyboard to select the text. Then type <span class="TypedEntry">rock and roll</span> and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content6.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
                <p>The idea is that a user could search for either "music" or "rock and roll" (or something close to it) and see the same micro content response in the search results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Add Link</span>.</li>
            <li>In the dialog, select <span class="Emphasis">Music.htm</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Click-OK.flsnp" /> The response to the right is replaced with the exact content from the Music.htm topic. You cannot click in the editor to the right and change any content, because it is just a link to the topic. To make changes, you need to edit the actual topic. You can quickly open the topic by clicking the link on the left side, or right-clicking the response on the right and selecting <span class="Emphasis">Open Link</span>.</p>

                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content7.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-File.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>Build and view the output again.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Search for <span class="TypedEntry">rock and roll</span>. The micro content displays in the search results, and it is the same as the topic; there is even an automatic link to the topic at the bottom of the micro content. Notice that there are no other search results, because this time we used the alternate phrase (rock and roll), and that phrase doesn't appear anywhere in the project, just in the Micro Content Editor.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content8.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>This method works well too, but topics are often larger than you would like for micro content. Even if it's relatively small, as in our example, you might want to use only part of it for the micro content. Therefore, you might want to use one of the other methods that we will talk about next.</p>

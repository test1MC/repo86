        <p>There are multiple methods for creating a micro content response. Let's start with a simple method, where we enter the response directly in the Micro Content Editor.</p>
        <h2>How to Create a Response in the Micro Content Editor</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the left side of the Micro Content Editor, click the phrase <span class="Emphasis">What is micro content?</span> so that the text is selected.</li>
            <li>Type <span class="TypedEntry">Music</span> and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy the following text and paste it on the right side of the Micro Content Editor, replacing the existing content.</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">Known as "The Live Music Capital of the World," Austin has an eclectic, vibrant music scene. There are more music venues per capita in Austin than in any other city in the United States.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-File.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Project</span> ribbon, and from the <span class="Emphasis">Build Primary</span> drop-down choose <span class="Emphasis">Build "All-About-Austin-HTML5."</span></p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">There are a few things you need to keep in mind when generating output designed with micro content for search results. First, it must be an HTML5 target. Second, the search engine must either be MadCap Search or Elasticsearch (as opposed to Google Search). And third, there is an option in the Target Editor to enable micro content in search results, which must be selected. Fortunately, all of this is already set up in the Austin project template, so we don't need to worry about it in this tutorial.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>When the target finishes building, double-click the row in the Builds grid at the bottom of the interface.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>In the output, search for <span class="TypedEntry">music</span> (no need to worry about the case). Your micro content displays at the top of the search results.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Micro-Content/Micro-Content4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>It works great, but the reason we do not usually recommend this method is because the same text already appears in one of the topics in the project. By entering this text manually in the Micro Content Editor, you are not single-sourcing. You can improve the situation by either creating a snippet to be used in both the topic and Micro Content Editor, or you can use one of the other methods that we'll go over next, which involving linking rather than manual entry of the response.</p>

        <p>Before we begin this tutorial, there are just a couple of things you should know.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Context-Sensitive Help</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/CSH/CSH-Definition.flsnp" /> This is different from a lot of features in Flare in that it usually requires a collaboration between the author and a software developer. The key to this relationship is the sharing of IDs that connect the specific pieces of documentation with the software user interface or links. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../CSH/CSH.htm">Context-Sensitive Help</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2 class="NoPageBreakBefore">Limitations of This Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Since CSH often involves a developer who is working on a software product, and we don't have that kind of resource in this tutorial, we aren't going to try to simulate that entire process. However, at the end of the tutorial, we will use a "call" to bring up specific documentation. It's the same information a developer would use to complete the connection on the software side, but we will use it in a slightly different, simpler way for the author to open the same output.</p>

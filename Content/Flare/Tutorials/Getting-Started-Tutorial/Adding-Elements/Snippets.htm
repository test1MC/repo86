        <p>You can use snippets in your project whenever you need to reuse the same content in more than one place, rather than rewriting or copying it. Then, when you need to make a change, you can modify the content in the snippet and the edits will automatically appear wherever you used the snippet. You don't need to make the same change multiple times.</p>
        <p>A&#160;snippet can be as short or long as you want. It can be just a few words, a sentence, or several paragraphs. Snippets can contain any type of content, including text, images, lists, or even other snippets.</p>
        <p>Let's create a short snippet and place it in our project.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />

        <h2>How to Create a Snippet</h2>
        <p>We will use Home.htm as the first topic that opens in our online output. There is some text in this topic that we also want to use in the Introduction.htm topic, which will be the first topic in our PDF&#160;output. Let's create a snippet so we can reuse this content in both topics.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Content Explorer, double-click <span class="Emphasis">Home.htm</span>. The topic opens in the XML&#160;Editor. </li>
            <li>Scroll down so you can see the area that contains a heading, four short paragraphs, and a list.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the first three paragraphs and the entire list (the text starting with "San Diego" and ending with "San Diegans").</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Getting-Started/Snippet1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth60Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, and click <span class="Emphasis">Create Snippet</span>. The Create Snippet dialog opens.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="Emphasis">Snippet File</span> field, type <span class="TypedEntry">San-Diego-Intro</span>. This is the name for your snippet.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="Emphasis">Project Folder</span> field, you can enter a location where you want to save your snippet. By default, snippets are saved in the Content folder in the Resources &gt; Snippets folder. This is the recommended location for snippets, so we will not change this path.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Getting-Started-Tutorial" />
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Snippet</span> field, use the scroll bar to review the content. You should see exactly the content you just selected (the text starting with "San Diego" and ending with "San Diegans"). </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The preview won't have any styling associated with it, so it will look somewhat plain. That's okay. The styles will show up in whatever topic the snippet is inserted into. But if anything else looks incorrect in the preview, you can click <span class="Emphasis">Cancel</span> and start again.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure the check box <span class="Emphasis">Replace Source Content with the New Snippet</span> is selected. Since we want to use the snippet in the current topic, this will automatically insert the snippet into that topic for us.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Create</span>. Flare creates the snippet, inserts it into the topic, and adds the snippet file to the Content Explorer. Notice that the structure bars on the left side of the content (representing the individual paragraphs and the list) have been replaced by a single structure bar (i.e., the snippet block), and the snippet is surrounded by light gray brackets.</p>

        <h2>How to Insert a Snippet</h2>
        <p>Now that we have created a snippet, we will insert it into another topic.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Content Explorer, double-click <span class="Emphasis">Introduction.htm</span>. The topic opens in the XML&#160;Editor. </li>
            <li>Click at the end of the <span class="Emphasis">Introduction</span> heading and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span> to create a new empty paragraph after it. This is where we will insert the snippet.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Insert</span> ribbon, and click <span class="Emphasis">Snippet</span>. The Insert Snippet Link dialog opens.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Select Snippet</span> section, navigate to <span class="Emphasis">Content &gt; Resources &gt; Snippets &gt; San-Diego-Intro.flsnp</span>. When you select the snippet, you will see it in the Preview section so you can confirm that you have selected the correct snippet.</p>
                <p>

            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Getting-Started-Tutorial" />
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>. The snippet appears in the topic between the main heading and the History section.</p>
                <p>

It will open in the XML&#160;Editor just like a topic. However, if you end up with many snippets over time, it might be difficult to locate the precise snippet you need. A quicker way to edit a snippet is to right-click on a snippet that is inserted in a topic and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span>.</p>

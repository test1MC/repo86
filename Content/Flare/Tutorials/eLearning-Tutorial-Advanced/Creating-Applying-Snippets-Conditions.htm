        <p>One of Flare's greatest strengths is its ability to single-source content. This simply means that you create the content once and reuse it in different ways, rather than doing a lot of rewriting, or copying and pasting. Single-sourcing content can save you a great deal of time and energy, and help to maintain consistency. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Introduction/Features/General-Key-Features1.htm#SingleSourcing">Single-Sourcing</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>Two of the most essential features for single-sourcing are snippets and conditions. We're going to use both of these types of features in the following steps in order to reuse some content. Variables are also commonly used for single-sourcing; we'll work with variables later in this tutorial.</p>

        <h2>How to Create a Snippet From Existing Content</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, let's create a subfolder to store any snippets that we create. In the Content Explorer, right-click the <span class="Emphasis">Resources</span> folder and select <span class="Emphasis">New &gt; Folder</span>. Type <span class="TypedEntry">Snippets</span> as the name for the folder and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Resources &gt; Snippets is the recommended location for your snippet files, but you can actually add them anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like. The same is true of any other resource files (they can be placed anywhere in the Content Explorer). You can also created nested folders under the Resources folder if you have many files that you need to organize.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the <span class="Emphasis">First Knowledge Check.htm</span> topic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the second question, highlight the text <span class="Emphasis">(Select all that apply.)</span>. Then, from the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon at the top of Flare, click <span class="Emphasis">Create Snippet</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Create Snippet dialog, enter <span class="TypedEntry">Select-All-That-Apply</span> as the file name for the new snippet.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The rest of the fields are set just as we want. (It's pointing to the correct folder, and we are replacing the selected content with the new snippet file.) So click <span class="Emphasis">Create</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>You should now see brackets (markers) around that text. This signifies that the content is actually contained in a separate file, located in the new folder you created in the Content Explorer. Therefore, you cannot edit that text in the topic file anymore; you need to open the separate snippet file to edit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets5.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You can create snippets for any content that is repeated in multiple places. Use your best judgment for the content where you create snippets. For example, in this same topic, you can see the words Correct and Incorrect, which are repeated throughout the course. You can also see that the correct and incorrect text next to the first instance of these ("The capital of Texas is Austin.") is repeated. Perhaps you want to turn any of these into snippets. In this tutorial, we're just going to focus on the one sentence that we've already turned into a snippet. Just know that there are all kinds of possibilities for creating snippets from content, whether it is just text or collections of any other types of content (e.g., tables, images, lists). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">To learn more, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Snippets/Snippets.htm">Snippets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h2>How to Find Text and Insert Snippets</h2>
        <p>Now that we have our snippet, we just need to insert it anywhere that the same content should be used. In this tutorial, we've already entered that text manually, so we just need to find all the places where it occurs. We'll use the Find and Replace feature to do that.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, click <span class="Emphasis">Find and Replace</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure the <span class="Emphasis">Find Text</span> tab is selected at the top of the window pane, and in the <span class="Emphasis">Find</span> field enter <span class="TypedEntry">(Select all that apply.)</span>. And make sure the rest of the options match those in the following image.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth60Percent" />

            <li>
                <p>At the bottom of the window pane, click <span class="Emphasis">Find All</span>.</p>
                <p>The window pane that opens at the bottom of the interface displays three files where the text is found. One of these is our new snippet, so we don't need to worry about that one. But we want to open the other two files to replace the text with the snippet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Double-click the row in the Find Results window pane for the <span class="Emphasis">Question 2.htm</span> topic.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets7.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>This opens that topic and highlights the text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the local toolbar of the XML Editor, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Interface/Buttons/Insert-Snippet-btn.png" alt="" title="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> (the face of the button, not the down arrow).</p>

            <li>
                <p>In the dialog, find and select the new snippet that you created, and click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The text is now replaced with the snippet.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click the snippet in the XML Editor, and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets9.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Find Results window pane at the bottom of Flare, double-click the row for the <span class="Emphasis">Second Knowledge Check.htm</span> topic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click the highlighted text and select <span class="Emphasis">Paste</span>. Now all instances of that text have been replaced with the snippet. In the future, you can simply insert the snippet wherever you need to use the same text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>And just to underscore the power of snippets, let's edit the text a little bit. Right-click the snippet at its location where you inserted it into the Second Knowledge Check topic, and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the snippet file that opens, add the word <span class="TypedEntry">answers</span> so that it now reads "(Select all answers that apply.)"</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Snippets10.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now open any of the topics where the snippet is inserted, and notice the edited text.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Add Conditions</h2>
        <p>A condition is a feature that you can apply to certain content or a file so that you can include or exclude it from a particular output. To start using conditions, the first thing you need to do is add them to a condition set file. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Conditions/Conditions.htm">Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Project Organizer on the left side of Flare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Expand the <span class="Emphasis">Conditional Text</span> folder, which is where all condition tags are stored.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Double-click <span class="Emphasis">Default</span> to open that condition tag set. This type of file can hold many conditions. And you can create as many condition tag sets as you need in order to organize all of your conditions. In this tutorial, we're just going to work with the Default condition tag set that is provided.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There are already a handful of conditions in this tag set. You may or may not end up using some of these, or you can rename them for other purposes if you want. Let's create some new conditions that we will use specifically for our eLearning content. In the local toolbar, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Ca-Co-Fl-Li-Mi/Interface/Buttons/New-Item-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This adds a new row to the condition tag set. Click <span class="Emphasis">NewTag</span> so that the text is highlighted, type <span class="TypedEntry">CombinationCourseOnly</span> for the name of the tag, and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>. Notice a color is automatically assigned for that row, but you can click the down arrow and choose a different color if you want.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Follow these steps again to create new condition rows with the following names:</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">KnowledgeCheck</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">KnowledgeCheckOnly</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">Test</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">TestOnly</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Instead of "Test" and "TestOnly," you could name the conditions "Quiz" and "QuizOnly." In fact, in your actual project, you can name conditions anything you want. Just make sure they're descriptive enough so any writers on your team can quickly identify the purpose of each condition. You can also use the Comment cell in the grid to provide information about each condition.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-File.flsnp" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Apply Conditions to Text</h2>
        <p>Now let's apply our new conditions to some content areas in the project. Conditions can be applied to all kinds of content and files, but in this tutorial we're just going to focus on some text, and then we'll also apply them to some entries in our table of contents (TOC).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From the Content Explorer, double-click the <span class="Emphasis">Home.htm</span> topic to open it.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At the end of the topic, add the following three paragraphs.</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">There is a knowledge check and a test later in this course.</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">There are knowledge checks at certain points in the course.</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">There is a test at the end of the course.</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>Let's add one more line of text at the end, which we'll use to begin the course in the online output. Type <span class="TypedEntry">START&#160;COURSE</span>.</p>
                <p>

            <li>
                <p>We want to turn this text into a link, so highlight it, and in the local toolbar click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Insert-Hyperlink-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>

However, because we want our link to have some specific text (START&#160;COURSE) as opposed to using an automated formula, we're going to use a hyperlink in this tutorial.</p>

            <li>
                <p>In the dialog that opens, make sure the Link to field at the top is set to <span class="Emphasis">File in Project</span>. Then, select the <span class="Emphasis">Introduction.htm</span> topic in the area below, and click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>. Now the text is a link, which is displayed in an orange, underlined format.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Now back to our conditions. We want to mark each of our new four lines of text to be associated with a different condition. The idea is that the conditioned text will only show up in certain output. To start, click anywhere in the line of the first paragraph that you added, and in the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon click <span class="Emphasis">Conditions</span>. </p>

If you were to select only a portion of the sentence, the condition would be applied only that selected text, and not to the whole paragraph.</p>

This color won't display in the output; it's simply there in the XML Editor to let you know that a condition has been applied to the paragraph.</p>

                <p>Repeat these steps to apply the following conditions to the other three lines:</p>
                <p>Second line: Apply the <span class="Emphasis">KnowledgeCheckOnly</span> condition.</p>
                <p>Third line: Apply the <span class="Emphasis">TestOnly</span> condition.</p>
                <p>Fourth line: Apply the <span class="Emphasis">ScreenOnly</span> condition.</p>

        <h2>How to Apply Conditions to TOC Entries</h2>
        <p>Currently, our project has two TOCs—one dedicated to online output, and another for print-based output. However, there is a lot of flexibility when it comes to TOCs in Flare. You could choose to create a separate TOC for each output that you generate, including a unique TOC for many different online outputs. Alternatively, you could create a single TOC to be used for multiple outputs, and apply conditions to certain entries in the TOC that should be reserved for only some outputs. That's what we're going to do in this tutorial. In the end, we want to create three different kinds of online outputs, but we'll use the same TOC for each of those outputs.</p>
        <p>So the first thing we need to do is open the TOC and apply some conditions to a few entries within it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If the TOC is not still open, from the Project Organizer double-click <span class="Emphasis">Online-TOC</span> to open it in the TOC Editor to the right.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>Select the <span class="Emphasis">First Knowledge Check</span> entry, and in the local toolbar click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Ca-Co-Fl-Li/Interface/Buttons/Run-Properties-btn2.png" />.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions12.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Properties dialog, select the <span class="Emphasis">Conditional Text</span> tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the check box next to <span class="Emphasis">KnowledgeCheck</span>. Then, click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions13.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
                <p>In the TOC Editor, the square next to that entry shows the color of the condition.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions14.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apply that same condition to the <span class="Emphasis">Second Knowledge Check</span> entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apply the <span class="Emphasis">KnowledgeCheckOnly</span> condition to the entry labeled <span class="Emphasis">The End</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apply the <span class="Emphasis">Test</span> condition to the <span class="Emphasis">Quiz</span> test node.</p>
                <p>When you're finished, it should look something like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Conditions15.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-File.flsnp" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To this point, we've created the conditions and applied them to some areas. But that doesn't mean we're done yet. We'll finish up our tasks related to conditions later when we create and develop our targets.</p>

        <h2>How to Review the Combination Course Output</h2>
        <p>Let's go through the course in the output to see all of the additions and changes that we've made in this tutorial.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The Home topic is the first one that you see in the output, even though it wasn't included in the table of contents (TOC). That's because it was already specified as the "Startup Topic" on the General tab of the Target Editor. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>Notice how this page has a different look and feel from the rest of the topics that we'll view as we progress through the course. That's because it is using a different template page. </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
                <p>First, it has the "hero" image behind the text "All About Austin." </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
                <p>Second, it has a footer at the bottom of the topic with information about the company and another instance of the logo. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View5.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
                <p>Third, there is no eLearning toolbar at the bottom of the text that lets you move to the next or previous topic, or see the progress of the course.</p>
                <p>Another thing to notice is the sentence just above the START&#160;COURSE link. It says, "There is a knowledge check and a test later in this course." In the source topic, there are a couple of other sentences, but we conditioned those out of this target, while including this sentence.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="Emphasis">START&#160;COURSE</span> link.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>At the bottom of the topic, notice the toolbar with the buttons and progress bar. The "Previous" button is disabled because this is the first topic in the table of contents (TOC) and it is using the template page containing the eLearning Toolbar proxy. Also notice that the color in the progress bar is orange, which we edited in the skin component to match the rest of our branding. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View7.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>, and notice the background color of the button, which we changed in the eLearning Toolbar skin component.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>Both of the questions on this page were marked as required in the topic, so notice that the Next button at the bottom is disabled until you answer both questions and click Submit. </p>
                <p>The First Knowledge Check page is shown because we included that condition in the output for this target. To refresh your memory, we had placed the "KnowledgeCheck" condition on this entry in the TOC. Choose <span class="Emphasis">Austin</span> as the answer for the first question, and click <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span>. The answer is correct, and the appropriate feedback displays.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View8.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The color and look of the selected circle can also be customized by using styles in your regular stylesheet. We're not going to make that change in this tutorial, but if you look at the stylesheet in one of the eLearning project templates that are built in to Flare, you can see where this was done. If you open that stylesheet in the Text Editor (rather than the regular Stylesheet Editor), you will see many custom styles that were created under a section called /* eLearning */. These styles control not only the look of selected circles and squares, but other things as well, such as feedback content.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/Text-Editor-Styles.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <span class="Emphasis">Long hot summers</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Snowfall in autumn</span> as answers for the second question. Then, click <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span>. Only one of those answers is correct, and the feedback indicates this.</p>
                <p>Also, notice that the Submit button doesn't have any space between it and the toolbar below. We'll fix this in a moment by adjusting the style in the stylesheet. But for now, let's keep reviewing the output.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View9.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Now that you've answered both of these required questions, the Next button is enabled in the toolbar. Click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>At the bottom of the next few pages, click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>, until you get to the Second Knowledge Check. Notice that the Next button at the bottom is enabled, because we marked both of the questions in this topic as optional.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For each of the answers in the Second Knowledge Check, select answers and click <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span>. Then, click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the next page, click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now you see the first page of the Quiz. This topic is linked to the test node in the TOC, so all of the topics that follow  will be graded (because they're under the test node in the TOC). Click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For Question 1, select <span class="Emphasis">Stephen F. Austin</span> and click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>. There is no Submit button here because we do not want to show instant feedback.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>For Question 2, select <span class="Emphasis">"Center for Urban Bat Colonies"</span>, and click <span class="Emphasis">Complete</span>.</p>
                <p>The test results page immediately displays. We did not create this page in the project, so Flare just used a default page. However, you have the option of creating and designing a custom search results page if you want<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../LMS/Process/Custom-Results-Page1.htm">Customizing a Results Page</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. One of the answers in the quiz was correct and the other was incorrect, so the results page indicates a score of only 50%, which is fail, because our pass percentage set in the test node is 75%. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Advanced/eLearning-Tutorial-Build-View10.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You can customize the look of the default test results page by adding a Test Results skin component to the project and modifying the styles within it. For example, if you wanted to change the text at the top to match the orange branding of the rest of the output, you would change the font color for the Title style in the Test Results Skin Editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../LMS/Other-Activities/Editing-Test-Results-Skin.htm">Working With the Test Results Skin</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

Although you would not want to provide instant feedback for a gradable quiz, you can still add feedback text for each answer, just as we did with the knowledge check topics. However, by not including the Submit button at each of those locations, the feedback text would simply be displayed in the final test results. </p>

        <h2>How to Fix the Spacing for the Submit Button</h2>
        <p>Before we continue with the other outputs, let's fix the spacing (or lack of it) below the Submit button in the knowledge check topics.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In Flare, open the <span class="Emphasis">Second Knowledge Check.htm</span> topic.</p>

        <p>You have probably heard a lot about single-sourcing, but maybe you are not sure how to get started with it in Flare. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basics and introduce some key features that prove to be essential for building and maintaining effective content.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Tutorials/Single-Sourcing-Chunks.flsnp" />
        <p>Okay, let’s see how this works in Flare…</p>

        <h2>How to Make Content Topic-Based</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>With your new project open in Flare, look at the Content Explorer. You’ll notice there are some topic files about Austin already in this project.</p>
                <p>

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Let's create a new topic to get a feel for what constitutes a topic. From the Content Explorer, right-click the root <span class="Emphasis">Content</span> folder, and from the context menu, select <span class="Emphasis">New &gt; Topic</span>.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>In the Add File dialog, in the <span class="Emphasis">File Name</span> field, type <span class="TypedEntry">Austin-Plants</span>. In the <span class="Emphasis">1st Heading</span> field, type <span class="TypedEntry">Plants in Austin</span>.  Click <span class="Emphasis">Add</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/Single-Sourcing/SSrc-Add-File.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>Flare's XML Editor automatically opens the new Austin-Plants.htm topic. In the first paragraph, copy and paste the following text at that location to replace the default text. (Depending on how you copy and paste the text, you might see an extra paragraph tag at the end. Just delete it.)</p>
                <div class="IndentMedium">
                    <p>Many plants thrive in Austin’s humid subtropical climate that consists of mild winters and long hot summers. Trees, shrubs, perennials, succulents, and vines are just a handful of plant types to choose from to work into any home garden or landscaping design. For inspiration on what to plant, be sure to visit the Zilker Botanical Garden.</p>
                    <p>Trees</p>
                    <p>The most popular trees in Austin are drought-resistant and provide shade from the hot sun.</p>
                    <p>When planting, consider grouping drought-tolerant plants together in sunny locations, and grouping plants that need more moisture and shade in protected areas. Austin receives approximately 34 inches of rain per year.</p>
                    <p>Vines</p>
                    <p>Vines are great because they grow vertically along walls, trellises, and fences. Climbers also provide privacy screening and color to brighten up an otherwise bare wall.</p>
                    <p>Garden Tools</p>
                    <p>Bringing a great outdoor space with lots of plants to life and maintaining it is easier with the right equipment, especially in Central Texas where the soils can be challenging. The following common garden tools can help you carry out just about any task in the yard: shovel, trowel, pruning shears, loppers, hoe, rake, spading fork, garden hose, wheelbarrow, and garden gloves. Lastly, don't forget to wear a wide-brimmed hat under that hot Austin sun.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>Look at the pasted text. There are two sections, “Trees” and “Vines,” that can be identified as types of plants and belong under the “Plants in Austin” heading. The other section, “Garden Tools,” is related but does not fit. It would be better as a separate topic (or chunk of content).</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Place the cursor anywhere in the “Trees” paragraph, and from the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, click the <span class="Emphasis">Style</span> drop-down and select <span class="Emphasis">h2</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Place the cursor anywhere in the “Vines” paragraph, and from the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, click the <span class="Emphasis">Style</span> drop-down and select <span class="Emphasis">h2</span>.</p>
                        <p>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Let's create a new topic for the Garden Tools subject. From the Content Explorer, right-click the <span class="Emphasis">Content</span> folder, and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">New &gt; Topic</span>.</li>
            <li>In the Add File dialog, in the <span class="Emphasis">File Name</span> field, type <span class="TypedEntry">Garden-Tools</span>. In the <span class="Emphasis">1st Heading</span> field, type <span class="TypedEntry">Garden Tools</span>.  Click <span class="Emphasis">Add</span>.</li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak />
            <li>
                <p>From the Austin-Plants.htm topic, cut the last paragraph describing Garden Tools and paste it into the new Garden-Tools.htm topic in the first paragraph under the heading (replacing the default text).</p>
                <p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go back to the Austin-Plants.htm topic and delete the heading for the Garden Tools text.</p>
                <p>You have created two new topics for the Austin project. The subject matter is related, but the topics now stand alone containing smaller chunks of information. This is topic-based authoring, which sets the stage for reusing content and single-sourcing features. </p>

        <h2>Home Topic Update</h2>
        <p>Before we move on, let’s add a mention of the main new planting topic to the Welcome heading of the project.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Content Explorer, double-click the <span class="Emphasis">Home.htm</span> topic to open it in the XML Editor.</li>

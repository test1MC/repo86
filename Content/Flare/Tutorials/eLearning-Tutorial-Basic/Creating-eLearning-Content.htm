        <p>The pages that you saw in the output in the previous lesson are the result of topics (combined with other files) in Flare. By using this template, you just need to decide what you want to add, what you want to replace, and what you want to remove.</p>
        <p>Let's start by removing some of the existing topics that we don't want to use. Then we'll replace the content in the ones we want to keep. Some of these topics just contain general information and various features, while other topics will include some interactive eLearning question sections.</p>

        <h2>How to Remove Topics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the left side of Flare, select the <span class="Emphasis">Content Explorer</span> accordion bar to open it.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In this template, the topics are all organized into separate folders in the Content Explorer. Expand the <span class="Emphasis">Course-Content</span> folder.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>Let's say we don't want to use topics that include the following features: hotspot popups, slideshow, video. So let's delete them from the project. To begin, right-click the topic named <span class="Emphasis">4-0-Hotspot Popups.htm</span>, and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Delete</span>. In the dialog that opens, click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All of these topics are linked in a table of contents (TOC) file, which is needed to provide the flow of the course (i.e., which topic is first, then what topic comes next, and so on). We don't want the topic that we're deleting to be part of the TOC anymore, so in the dialog that opens, click <span class="Emphasis">Remove Links</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>We could repeat this same step for the other topics that we want to delete, but there's a faster way. In the local toolbar at the top of the Content Explorer, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Show-Files-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. This splits the folders and files in the Content Explorer, so that whatever folder you select on the left side shows the contents on the right side.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />

            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>With the first folder selected on the left side, hold down your <span class="Emphasis">CTRL</span> key and select the following topics on the right side:</p>
                <ul class="Emphasis">
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <p>4-2-Zilker-Park.htm</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press <span class="Emphasis">DELETE</span>, and in the dialog click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>In the dialog that open, click <span class="Emphasis">Remove Links</span>.</p>
                <p>The topics are removed. You'll notice that the numbers in the remaining topic file names go 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. But that's okay. The topics were only named that way (with the numbers) in the first place so that you could see their intended order in the TOC. You can rename the topics to anything you want, and don't need to include numbers in the topic file names at all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the local toolbar of the Content Explorer, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Show-Files-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> again to remove the split view.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Replace Topic File Names and Content</h2>
        <p>We'll get to some of the eLearning question sections in the project soon. But first, let's replace some informational content in some of the topics, and let's rename those topic files while we're at it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, let's rename some of the topic files in the project. In the Content Explorer, under <span class="Emphasis">Course-Content</span>, click once on <span class="Emphasis">1-Course-Title.htm</span>, and then press <span class="Emphasis">F2</span> on your keyboard. This highlights the file name text, but not the extension.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content5.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Type <span class="TypedEntry">San-Diego-Course-Intro</span>, and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only" />
            <li>
                <p>In the dialog that opens, click <span class="Emphasis">Update Links</span>. The Content Explorer should now look like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Create-Content6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat these steps to rename the other topics in that folder as follows. In the dialog that opens showing existing links that will be affected by the name change, click <span class="Emphasis">Update Links</span> each time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Rename <span class="Emphasis">2-Just-Text.htm</span> to <span class="Emphasis">History</span>.</p>

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Rename <span class="Emphasis">5-Drop-Downs.htm</span> to <span class="Emphasis">Beer</span>.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Rename <span class="Emphasis">8-IFrame.htm</span> to <span class="Emphasis">Zoo</span>.</p>

                <p>In the XML Editor, replace <span class="Emphasis">Austin, Texas</span> in the first paragraph with <span class="Emphasis">San Diego, California</span>. We'll leave the rest of the topic as it is.</p>

                    <p>San Diego was incorporated in 1850, the same year California became a state. However, before that, it had been part of the Spanish Empire, First Mexican Empire, and Mexican United States.</p>
                    <p>Today, San Diego is the second-largest city in California and the eighth-largest city in the United States.

It might be easiest to replace the paragraphs first, and then each bullet item after that; if you copy and paste the entire text into the tile at once, you might need to reapply the bullets from the Home ribbon. Also, if the tiles seem to shift in the editor, don't worry about it; that can happen when your workspace is a certain size and the tiles can't be shown side-by-side as a result. </p>

                    <p>Although it is located along the Pacific Ocean, San Diego County doesn't have the constant, uniform weather you may associate with coastal California.

You will use some of these images later. If you cannot download the ZIP&#160;file, you can just use any images you happen to have on your computer already just to finish the tutorial. Just keep in mind that if your images are different sizes than the ones in the ZIP file, your results will look different than what you see in the rest of this tutorial.</p>

                <p>Let's add one more drop-down effect. We could do this by copying and pasting one of the current drop-downs and replacing the text. But let's insert a new drop-down manually. At the end of the first paragraph under the Beer heading, press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span> to create a new empty paragraph.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Copy and paste the following text at that location.</p>
                <div class="TypedEntry">
                    <p>AleSmith Brewing Company</p>
                    <p>AleSmith was founded in 1995. It has won many medals in the World Beer Cup competition. One of their beers, the San Diego Pale Ale .394, was created in honor of San Diego Padres legend Tony Gwynn.</p>

        <h2>How to Replace and Add Knowledge Check Content</h2>
        <p>In addition to the Course-Content folder in the Content Explorer, this project template has a couple of other folders. One is currently holding topics for knowledge checks that can be added at various spots in the eLearning course to let learners check on their knowledge gained to that point. The question sections in these topics are not intended to be graded or part of a quiz.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Content Explorer, expand the <span class="Emphasis">Course-Knowledge-Check</span> folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Double-click <span class="Emphasis">First-Knowledge-Check.htm</span> to open that topic. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This topic has two knowledge check question sections, including multiple possible answers and instant feedback areas. Replace the question in the first section with the following:</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">Where does San Diego rank in size in the state of California?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This is a multiple choice question, where only one of the answers is correct. This is indicated by the use of radio buttons (circles) next to each answer. Replace the text for the three possible answers with the following.</p>
                <div class="TypedEntry">
                    <p>Largest city in the state</p>
                    <p>Second largest city in the state</p>
                    <p>Third largest city in the state</p>

            <li>
                <p>Let's add one more possible answer. After the third answer, press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span> and add the following text:</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The second section is multiple response, which means that more than one answer can be selected as correct. This is indicated by squares next to each possible answer. Replace the question with the following, leaving the part after it that says "Select all that apply."</p>
                <p class="TypedEntry">Which of the following are true regarding San Diego's climate?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Replace the answers with the following:</p>
                <div class="TypedEntry">
                    <p>It snows along the coast throughout November and December.</p>
                    <p>Valleys can be cool at night.</p>
                    <p>The desert areas can get extremely hot.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the second and third squares so that they have check marks in them. The first square should not be selected as a correct answer. When you are all finished, it should look as follows.</p>

                <p>We're going to replace the first line of text with something called a snippet, which is a separate little file containing content that can be reused in multiple places throughout a project. In the Content Explorer, expand the <span class="Emphasis">Resources</span> folder. Under that, expand <span class="Emphasis">Snippets</span>. Then, click and drag the <span class="Emphasis">Feedback-Correct.flsnp</span> file and drop it just before the placeholder text ("Enter feedback for correct answers").

                <p>Drag the <span class="Emphasis">Feedback-Incorrect.flsnp</span> snippet file in front of the other placeholder text. Then, press your space bar to add a space between the snippet and the placeholder text. Finally, replace the placeholder text with this:</p>

                <p>Notice the introduction topic for the quiz, as well as five separate topics that hold question sections. For the purposes of this tutorial, let's get rid of some of the question topics. Delete <span class="Emphasis">Question3.htm</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Question4.htm</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Question5.htm</span>, so that you are left with just the following three topics. When you see the Link Update dialog, select <span class="Emphasis">Remove Links</span>.</p>

                <p>Currently, this is a multiple choice question, where only once answer can be selected. But we want it to be a multiple response question, where multiple answers can be selected. So let's change it. Right-click any of the eLearning structure bars to the left of the content. In other words, right-click one of the bars that corresponds directly to that question section, but don't right-click any of the bars that have the "p" (paragraph) label on them. Then, from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Switch to Multiple Response</span>.</p>

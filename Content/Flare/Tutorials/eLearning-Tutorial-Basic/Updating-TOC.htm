            <MadCap:concept term="FilterProjects" />Updating the Table of Contents</h1>
        <p>This project template is already set up with a table of contents (TOC). It contains links to the topics we've been working on, and it's used to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Tells Flare the order that the topics should be displayed in the output</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tells Flare where the quiz should begin (via a test node)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tells Flare which topics should be part of the quiz and therefore gradable</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, even though the TOC was already set up when we began, we've removed some topics from the project. We just need to update the TOC to clean it up a bit.</p>
        <h2>How to Update the TOC</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the left side of Flare, select the <span class="Emphasis">Project Organizer</span> accordion bar to open that window pane.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Expand the <span class="Emphasis">TOCs</span> folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Double-click <span class="Emphasis">Online-TOC (Primary)</span> to open that TOC in an editor to the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Update-TOC1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Notice the entries in the TOC that match the headings in the topics. You'll also notice a couple of other things. First, a few of the squares next to TOC entries have colored squares. These colors represent conditions, which we're not going to cover in this tutorial, but you can learn about them in the eLearning Advanced Tutorial. Second, there are a few places where you can see flag icons and the text [[[Missing Linked File System.LinkedTitle]]]. Those are places that once linked to topics in the project, but since the topics have been removed, those links are now missing. Let's get rid of those entries. Click the first entry with the missing link text and press <span class="Emphasis">DELETE</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat this for the other two missing links. The TOC should now look like this. It's a combination of course topics, knowledge check topics, and test topics.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Update-TOC2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Notice the final entry called "Austin Quiz." This has a question mark on the icon next to it, and an arrow also appears to the left of that. The question mark icon indicates that this is something called a "test node," which signifies the start of a gradable quiz. Click the arrow to expand the node and see the question topics under it. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Tutorials/LMS/eLearning-Basic/Update-TOC3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We need to clean up a few things for the quiz. First, click the <span class="Emphasis">Austin Quiz</span> test node, and press <span class="Emphasis">F2</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Change the text to <span class="TypedEntry">San Diego Quiz</span> and press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, delete the final three missing link entries, which once pointed to the three test questions that we deleted earlier. When you are finished, it should look like this.</p>

You just click and drag the topic from the Content Explorer to the TOC.</p>

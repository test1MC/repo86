        <p>We haven't even done anything yet, but the project is already set up to produce some online courses. One course is set up to display content plus a gradable test at the end. A second course is set up to display content plus knowledge checks throughout the course. And a third course is set up as a combination of these, containing both knowledge checks and a quiz at the end. The great thing is that all three courses are drawing from the same content sources files, so there is no duplication of effort.</p>
        <p>Let's build and view output from these courses to see how it looks and works.</p>

        <p>Creating context-sensitive Help (CSH) is mostly a joint effort between <span class="EmphasisItalic">you (the author)</span> and the <span class="EmphasisItalic">software developer</span>. There are tasks that you must perform and tasks that the developer must perform in order for CSH to be implemented successfully. For this reason, it is essential that you communicate clearly with the developer when planning, creating, and implementing CSH. Other individuals (managers, other Help authors, etc.) may also be involved as well, particularly in the early planning stages.</p>
        <p>However, there might be times when you function as both the author and the developer. For example, this might be the case if you are generating HTML5 output and simply want to create links on a website that open specific parts of your output. In that situation, you might first generate the online output with the CSH information. Then you might serve as the developer, modifying pages on a website to include CSH links pointing to your documentation.</p>

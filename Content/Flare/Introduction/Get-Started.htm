                        <h2>Key Concepts and Features</h2>
                        <p>There are hundreds of features in Flare. But you don’t need to try to use all (or even many) of them. Become acquainted with the <a href="Features/Key-Features.htm">most important concepts and Flare’s key features</a> to discover which ones might be particularly important to you.</p>
                        <h2>Workspace</h2>
                        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s workspace is flexible, uses a modern Multiple Document Interface (MDI), and gives you several options to work the way that you want. Get to know some of the <a href="../Interface/Interface-Files/Interface-Files.htm">more important parts of the workspace</a>.</p>
                        <h2>Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Before starting your first project, you might want to explore ideas for developing your <a href="../Architecture/Architecture.htm">project architecture</a>. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Introduction/Architecture-Summary.flsnp" /> Some of the information provided here might be beyond a brand new user, but it is still a good idea to review it to help you make important decisions up front rather than making extensive changes later.</p>

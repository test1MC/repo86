            <MadCap:concept term="FilterIntroduction" />Locating Content in a Project</h1>
        <p>As you create, add, and edit content, or import files, your project may get bigger. That is okay since Flare can handle projects of all sizes; ranging from a few content files up to thousands of files. Flare also has features for helping you manage and work in your project effectively as it expands, or if its structure gets complex. For insight on how to organize your documentation, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Architecture/External-Architecture/Flare-Project-Structures.htm">Flare Project Structures</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/LMS/LMS-Reuse-Find-Content.flsnp" /> You know content has been written, but are not sure exactly where it is in the project. How can you best locate pieces of content or files? How do you know what else might need updating if you change something? How do you find topics that have a relationship with other topics?</p>
        <p>Flare provides several features to help locate specific content in a project.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />
        <h2>Content Explorer</h2>
        <p>A project that is well organized can make it easier to find content. Use the Content Explorer in Flare’s interface to hold all of the content-related items in your project—for both topics and non-topic files (e.g., topics, images, stylesheets, snippets). In the Content Explorer, create folders, subfolders, and files to arrange content into logical groups that make sense for project needs.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Snippets and the Link Viewer</h2>
        <p>Single-sourcing, or reusing content through the snippets feature, is relevant and beneficial when trying to find and update content. In addition, the Link Viewer is a useful tool for finding files (e.g., topics, snippets, stylesheets, table of contents) that have link dependencies with another. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Folders-Files/Viewing-File-Links.htm">Viewing File Links</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">By default, snippets are stored in the Content Explorer &gt; Resources folder (although you can store them anywhere). If you have a topic open that includes a snippet, you can right-click the snippet and select <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span>.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Snippets/Open-Snippet-File-ContextMenu.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>The snippet file opens in the editor. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Do-One-Following.flsnp" /></p>
            <p>Right-click to <span class="Emphasis">Locate in Explorer</span>. Of course, once you find the content you are looking for in the snippet, you can edit and save the updates for every instance of the snippet in the project.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Snippets/Locate-Snippet-Explorer.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Or, if you want to view links to and from the file, select <span class="Emphasis">View &gt; Link Viewer</span>. Click the open snippet file to give it focus, and view other files in the Link Viewer that the snippet is linked to. If you locate the link you are looking for, you can open the corresponding file directly from the Link Viewer.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Snippets/Find-Snippet-Link-Viewer.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Concepts/Concept-Definition.flsnp" />   You can also make use of the concepts feature to help keep track of which topics to update with similar concepts in them. This workflow is intended to help the author, and is for internal use.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Keep in mind, the concepts feature is also used to mark “related topics,” or “see also” links intended to help the end users find information in the output. This is not the same thing as using concepts for internal authoring. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Concepts/Concepts.htm">Concepts</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You might have a dozen topics spread throughout your project about “subject-x.” If you have an update to make on subject-x, how do you know where and what other topics might need updating regarding the subject?</p>
            <p>You can use the concepts feature as a marker, or a reminder. As you create topics that involve subject-x, create a concept term to insert into every topic. This might help you find similar topics later.</p>
            <p>Open a topic, and place the cursor at the beginning of the heading about subject-x.</p>
            <p>From the <span class="Emphasis">View</span> ribbon, select <span class="Emphasis">Concept Window</span>. The window pane opens to the right of the editor.</p>
            <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Terms</span> section, enter a concept term (e.g., subject-x).</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Concepts/Concept-Ex1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>. The concept is inserted into the topic.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Concepts/Concept-Ex2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>From the open topic, you can copy the concept term, and paste it into other topics that discuss subject-x.</p>
            <p>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-All-Files.flsnp" />
            </p>
            <p>At a later time, you have some new material to describe subject-x, but you don’t recall which topics might need updating. But you do know you have a concept term about it stored.</p>
            <p>If you open the Concepts window pane, you can expand the term and see a list of all the topics containing that term.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Concepts/Concept-Ex3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Find and Replace</h2>
        <p>Another great feature for authors to use for locating specific pieces of content is Find and Replace. Flare is equipped with a Find and Replace window pane to search for text in more than one file, and a Quick Find widget to search for text in a file that is open.</p>
        <p>Use this feature to search for (and replace) specific text in your project. You also have the option to find and replace elements such as custom tags, MadCap-specific features, markup, inline styles, and style classes. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Editor-Tools/Find-Replace/Find-Replace.htm">Find and Replace</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You have created an eLearning course about Austin, Texas. It is not a large project, but you want to find which test question addresses the music scene. You know the question is there, but you are not sure which one it is—and you don't want to open each question file to find it.</p>
            <p>From the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> ribbon, select <span class="Emphasis">Find and Replace</span>. The Find and Replace in Files window pane opens to the <span class="Emphasis">Find Text</span> tab.</p>
            <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Find</span> field, enter <span class="TypedEntry">music</span>. In the <span class="Emphasis">Find in</span> field, select <span class="Emphasis">Whole Project</span>. Expand the <span class="Emphasis">Options</span> drop-down, and select <span class="Emphasis">Match case</span>. The parameters of this search should send you in the right direction. Select <span class="Emphasis">Find All</span>.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Find-Replace/Find-Replace-Ex1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>The Find Results 1 window pane opens. You see the search returned several files, but only one of them is in the test part of the course. You know that the file you are looking for is Question3.htm.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Find-Replace/Find-Replace-Ex2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>If you want to quickly find text in an open topic, press <span class="Emphasis">CTRL+F</span>. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Editor-Tools/Find-Replace/Main-Activities/Using-Quick-Find-Replace-Widgets.htm">Using the Quick Find and Replace Widgets</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <p>The eLearning features in Flare create simple linear workflows, where material is arranged in a straightforward and progressive way.</p>

                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/LMS/LMS-Start-Template-Note.flsnp" /> Alternatively, you can create a course from scratch using an existing project, or using another project template.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> See <MadCap:xref href="../Process/Process-eLearning-Content.htm">Process for eLearning Content</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Print-Only-Topics/Flare/LMS/Process-eLearning-Content.htm">Process for eLearning Content</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h2>Types of Courses</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/LMS/Types-Courses.flsnp" />
        <div class="note">
            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Keep in mind that Flare enables you to create advanced innovative eLearning experiences. Courses are highly customizable and scalable. Flare allows for many ways to enhance a course itself, improve the online presence, or create a unique learning center. You can leverage features such as single-sourcing, cascading stylesheets, skins, responsive design, multi-channel publishing, reviews, source control, importing and exporting, translation, and integration with Central.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p class="Tip-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"> Depending on how you want a learner to begin a course, you can setup a Home page “eLearning center” or “dashboard” to launch eLearning elements.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Course Differences</h2>
        <p>All course types can be composed of learning topics, interactive content (e.g., videos, slideshows, drop-downs, hotspot popups), and question sections (e.g., adding a question, answers, feedback, and more).</p>
        <p>In a knowledge check course type, the course includes ungraded knowledge check topics for review purposes. These topics can be scattered throughout the course to help learners determine how well they are understanding the content. These checks usually consist of question sections that relate to the course content and learning objectives.</p>
        <p>A quiz course type is different from a knowledge check because a quiz includes a formal graded test, typically at the end of a course. The test is evident by the addition of a test node in the table of contents (TOC). It is an assessment specifically designed to determine learners’ level of comprehension.</p>
        <h2>Course Considerations</h2>
        <p>Since the goals of each course type might vary, then it stands to reason that how it is structured or organized will most likely vary as well. If you are creating a course from scratch (i.e., you are not using the eLearning template), there are certain pieces that need to be included to make it work. </p>
        <p>The following lists a few concepts that are different for each course type. Keep these in mind when developing your course. </p>

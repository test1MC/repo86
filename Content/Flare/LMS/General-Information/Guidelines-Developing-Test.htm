        <p>If you have never developed a course before, there are many online resources from the eLearning industry that provide excellent insight on how to do it. The following are simple guidelines to help you get started.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />
        <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
        <p>The way your course is presented or designed will take shape as you start to define the learning objectives. Determine the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What is the overall goal, and how does it fit into your eLearning program?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Who is your audience, and what do you expect the audience to learn?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>How can you best take advantage of Flare's single-sourcing features, and HTML5 skin options?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Knowledge Check Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a storyboard (or outline) for the course. Be sure to identify key concepts, learning objectives, and knowledge check points.</p>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">A storyboard is  a visual outline of each part of your eLearning course where you can plan out every detail. This is a great way to organize the story you want to tell for training. Creating a storyboard can be done using a piece of paper, a tool that supports flow diagrams, or a simple text editor. There are resources online to learn about storyboarding. </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create an engaging introduction that clearly states the expectations of the course.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use relevant graphics, multimedia, blocks of text, bulleted points, etc., to aid in retaining information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Include intuitive navigation throughout the course.</p>

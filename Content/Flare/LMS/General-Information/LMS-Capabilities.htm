You know of at least two departments, documentation and training, that are constantly recreating the same type of information for clients. The two teams don’t normally communicate with one another, and they use different applications to present similar material in a slightly different way. Most members of each team are upset they can’t easily share information with each other.</p>
            <p>You hear about Flare, and its single-sourcing capabilities. You were sold at words “reusing content,” and “centralized source of content.” You are very intrigued because as a content management tool, Flare is also an eLearning authoring tool. Your gut tells you that Flare can bridge the gap between the technical documentation and the L&amp;D disciplines at your company, and offer effective solutions.</p>
            <p>You know that if you implemented Flare for your organization, it could unite the teams, reduce duplicated work, streamline processes, reduce costs and frustrations, and deliver modern online content to customers.</p>
            <p>Six months later… You are the Director of Technical Communication at your company. Your team consists of documentation, training, and L&amp;D employees. The approach to delivering different levels of support has changed. Instead of viewing deliverables as separate departmental functions, you all work together to create the best learning experiences for the client. </p>
            <p>Inefficient applications have been retired, and Flare is used by everyone. Multiple authors (technical writers, instructional designers, trainers, etc.) use the same content files (e.g., multimedia, text, images) to create HTML5 output targets, eLearning courses, or PDF training guides specific to their task.</p>
            <p>You’ve noticed the following:</p>

        <p>When authoring in Flare, information is created in “topics.” The topics are created and arranged in the Content Explorer. They can be organized according to learning objectives, key concepts, practical applications, course types, etc. See <MadCap:xref href="../General-Information/Guidelines-Developing-Test.htm">Guidelines for Developing a Course</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/LMS/LMS-Topic-Based.flsnp" /> When we talk about topics in the eLearning context, they are similar to terms such as learning blocks, content blocks, building blocks, learning modules, “chunks of training,” etc.</p>
        <h2>How to Create eLearning Topics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open a project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the Content Explorer's local toolbar, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Interface/Buttons/Create-New-Topic-File-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. This opens the Add File dialog to create or import a new topic. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Topics/Main-Activities/Creating-Topics.htm">Creating Topics</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Replace the default text in the topic with learning information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Save-File.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat steps 2 through 4 for as many eLearning topics as needed.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the Content Explorer, you can create custom folders and subfolders. This can help you organize related content. For example, in the image below, the folders are labeled as Course-Content, Course-Knowledge-Check, and Course-Test. The eLearning topics are placed in the appropriate folders.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../Topics/General-Information/Topic-Based-Authoring.htm">Topic-Based Authoring</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

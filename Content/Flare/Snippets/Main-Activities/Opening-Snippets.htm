        <p>After you create or add snippets to your project, they are stored in the Content Explorer (Content &gt; Resources &gt; Snippets). You can open as many existing snippets as you want at one time and make modifications to them. Each snippet displays in its own page of the XML Editor and remains accessible as you work. As you open more snippets or other elements (e.g., topics, targets, tables of contents), each page displays in the appropriate editor (e.g., XML Editor, Target Editor, TOC Editor). By default, the most recently opened page is on the left side of the editor section in Flare, and the previously opened pages shift to the right. The active page displays on top of the other pages, and you can make any page the active one (or "the one on top") by simply clicking its tab.</p>

                <p>Micro content phrase/response combinations are not the same as snippets. In addition, micro content and snippets should not be thought of as an either/or proposition. It is good to use both in your project. However, micro content does have relationships with snippets in a few ways.</p>

                        <p>When creating micro content, one of the methods you can use is to link a phrase to a regular snippet in the project.</p>
                        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../Process/Creating-Micro-Content.htm#Method2">Response Method 2: Linking Phrases to Entire Topics or Snippets</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                        <h2>Inserting Regular Snippets</h2>
                        <p>Another way to create a micro content response is to enter content directly in the Micro Content Editor. This can include inserting regular snippets in the editor, just as you would in a normal topic.</p>

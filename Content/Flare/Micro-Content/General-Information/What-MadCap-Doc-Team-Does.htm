                <p>We currently do not use micro content for chatbots or other applications that require extra programming outside of a Flare project. However, we do use micro content extensively for featured snippets in search results of the output.<span class="micro-content-only-inline"> See the full topic to learn what our approach involves.</span> <span class="topic-only">Our approach involves the following.</span> </p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>Our projects are integrated with MadCap Central, which gives us access to analytics on our outputs<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Central/General-Information/Central-Analytics/Central-Analytics.htm">Central Analytics</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. We sort the Phrases report to see which terms end users are entering most often for searches.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content-Doc-Team-Analytics1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-HTML5-Guide,Flare-Guides.Flare-Search-Guide" />
        <p>We also use a filter to show only the terms for which we do not yet have micro content (i.e., an X indicates no micro content exists yet, and a check mark shows keywords for which we have already created micro content) . This makes it easier for us to prioritize the creation of new micro content phrases and responses.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content-Doc-Team-Analytics2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <p>Although some of our micro content is created proactively (i.e., as we write topics), we rely heavily on analytics results to help us provide responses for queries that users are entering most, and to fill in missing gaps.</p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Micro-Content-Guide" />
        <h2>Number of Micro Content Files</h2>
        <p>Based on the search phrases we noticed in our Central Analytics reports, we decided to make three categories of micro content files for each product, storing them in a Resources &gt; MicroContent subfolder.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content-Doc-Team-Number-Files.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth40Percent" />

        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Micro-Content-Guide,Flare-Guides.Flare-HTML5-Guide,Flare-Guides.Flare-Search-Guide" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Definitions </span>This micro content file holds simple definitions, sometimes with an image included, but usually not.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content23.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth85Percent" />

            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Quick Steps </span>When viewing analytics, we noticed phrases containing verbs (e.g., apply condition tag, import Word), indicating that users are trying to find information on how to complete a specific task. Therefore, we created a micro content file and named it “Quick-Steps.” The response for each of these micro content phrases is a very brief set of steps, usually a shortened version of the main topic for that task. It also usually includes a visual element to the right, such as an image or animated gif.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth85Percent" />

            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Micro-Content-Guide,Flare-Guides.Flare-Search-Guide,Flare-Guides.Flare-HTML5-Guide" />
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Mini Landing Pages </span>We discovered that the vast majority of search phrases in our reports are simply words or short phrases (e.g., skin, template pages, output), rather than actual questions or even phrases containing a verb. Therefore, we created another micro content file and named it “Mini-Landing-Pages.” Since these search phrases are somewhat vague (e.g., if people search for “skin,” we don’t know which aspect of skins they want to know about), the responses associated with the micro content phrases are designed to be mini landing pages, containing a short snapshot of the subject. This usually includes a table with links to processes, tasks, or other information that we think the user is most likely trying to find, as well as visual element to the right, perhaps even a tutorial or video link.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Structure of Responses</h2>
        <p>In many cases, we wanted to include both text and either multimedia or images in our micro content responses. With text usually appearing on the left or top, and the multimedia or image on the right or bottom, we decided to create some different responsive layouts; this allows the content to stack when viewed on a small screen<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Responsive-Design/Creating-Responsive-Layouts.htm">Creating Responsive Layouts</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>

        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Micro-Content-Guide" />
        <h2>Skin Styles</h2>
        <p>As far as the skin is concerned, we used the default settings for most areas of the micro content. However, we did change the following.</p>
        <p>We decided to increase the height of the responses because most of our content was requiring users to click the expand button to see all of the information. So on the <span class="Emphasis">Styles</span> tab of the Skin Editor, we expanded <b>Search Micro Content Response &gt; Size</b>, and we changed the default <b>Maximum Height</b> from 200 px to <b>400 px</b>. Although some of our micro content responses still require users to use the expand function to see everything, the majority of our responses can now be seen without doing this on a large screen.</p>

        <h2>Response Links From Topics and Single-Sourcing Content</h2>
        <p>In the vast majority of cases, we create micro content from selected text within a topic. This lets us single-source content while automatically including a link back to the topic in the search results.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Micro-Content/Micro-Content-Topic-Link.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <p>We also created some special styles that let us hide content in the micro content response, while displaying all of the content in the full topic. In addition, we have styles for changing the look of content when shown in the micro content response (e.g., less space between steps). The idea is that the micro content response should be a smaller representation of what a user sees in the full topic, without having to create two sets of content. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Other-Activities/Single-Sourcing-Micro-Content-Using-Styles.htm">Single-Sourcing Micro Content Using Styles</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Print-Only-Topics/Flare/Micro-Content/Single-Sourcing-Micro-Content-Using-Styles.htm">Single-Sourcing Micro Content Using Styles</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

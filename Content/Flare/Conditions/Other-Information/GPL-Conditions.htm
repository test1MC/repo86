        <p>With Global Project Linking, you can import content and project files contained in another <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project, thus allowing you to maintain the information in one location but reuse it in any other project. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Global-Project-Linking/Global-Project-Linking.htm">Global Project Linking</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>In addition to specifying certain files or file types to include or exclude from the import, you can go a level deeper through the use of condition tags. If you have applied condition tags to files in your project, you can use the <b>Import Conditions</b> field to tell <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to include or exclude certain files, depending on the condition tags that are applied to them at the file level. Simply click the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button to choose the conditions. In the Conditional Text dialog for this feature, you can use the Basic or Advanced mode for creating condition tag expressions.</p>

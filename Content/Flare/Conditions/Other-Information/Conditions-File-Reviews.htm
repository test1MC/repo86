        <p>If you are using MadCap Contributor for topic reviews, you can include or exclude content in those files based on condition tags. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews-Contributions/Reviews/Sending-Files-Review1.htm">Sending Files for Review in Contributor or Flare</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>After choosing the files in the wizard and selecting <b>Send a review package file</b>, you can click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Conditions-btn2.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" alt="" /> toward the bottom of the page. The Conditional Text dialog opens.</p>
        <p>You can include or exclude conditions in a couple of different ways, or even use both:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Target Settings </span>The easiest method is to click the <span class="Emphasis">Target Expressions</span> drop-down and select a target in your project. The dialog is automatically populated based on the included and excluded conditions in that target.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Manual </span>You can also complete this dialog manually, using the same steps that are used in the target for including and excluding certain condition tags. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">For more information about the Basic and Advanced modes, see <MadCap:xref href="../Other-Activities/Creating-Basic-Advanced-Tag-Expressions.htm">Creating Basic and Advanced Tag Expressions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Topics-Guide">For more information about the Basic and Advanced modes, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>

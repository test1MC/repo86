        <p>When adding a new file to a project, you can associate conditions with that file. This saves time because you can make sure that all of your new files created from the Add File dialog are conditioned when you create them, rather than having to go back and add condition tags to them later.</p>
        <p>In the Add File dialog, expand the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> area at the bottom. Then next to the <span class="Emphasis">Condition Tags</span> field, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/All/Interface/Buttons/Browse-Ellipses-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> and select the relevant conditions.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../Interface/Dialogs/Add-File-Dialog.htm">Add File Dialog</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../Process/Applying-Conditions-Content1.htm">Applying Conditions to Content</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

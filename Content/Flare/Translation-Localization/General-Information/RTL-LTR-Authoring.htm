        <h2>Bi-Directional XML Editor</h2>
        <p>Full authoring of right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) text is supported in the XML Editor.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> RTL text is readable and can be edited in the XML Editor.</li>
            <li>CSS and HTML direction properties are supported (e.g., "direction: rtl" and dir="rtl"). The following occur if these properties are set to "right."<ul><li>Text is right-aligned.</li><li>Tables flow from RTL (i.e., cell 1 is at the top right, cell 2 is to the left of it).</li><li>Bulleted lists and numbered lists are to the right of their content instead of left.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If an RTL language is selected for the project or topic, the default direction for content is right-to-left. If an LTR language is selected, the default direction is left-to-right.</li>

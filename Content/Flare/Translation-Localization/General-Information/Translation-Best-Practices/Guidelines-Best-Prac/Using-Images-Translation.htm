            <p>When it comes to working with images for a translation project, it is highly beneficial to use both the MadCap Flare and Capture products together. Capture caters to the translation workflow to mitigate common issues that might otherwise occur with images. Images not only illustrate what you need to say, but they serve as valuable tools for reducing the overall word count in a document. <span class="topic-only">Consider the following when using images for translation:</span></p>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Use MadCap Capture</span> Since the Capture application is closely integrated with Flare, they are both optimized for translation. Capture is the only application that makes translating graphic callouts easy and possible. It does this by writing the image callout text to its own XML file (i.e., a PROPS file), which accompanies the image file. A translator can  translate the text in the XML file, and if using Capture to view the image, can account for any text expansion right away. This text is also added to your project's translation memory.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Do Not Embed Text</span> Try not to embed text in graphics that need to be translated. Instead write the text in a table, as a bulleted list below the graphic, or don't use text at all.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Text Expansion</span> Be mindful that the appearance of your graphics might change if the translated text is significantly shorter or longer than the source text. You can opt to simply not add text to your images, or you could employ MadCap Capture to work with Flare, since the two applications handle this problem seamlessly.</p>

            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Provide Files to Translator</span> If you are using other programs such as PhotoShop, Illustrator, Visio, etc., be sure to provide translators with source files and all layered files for images. This allows translators to create images to the target language properly.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Use Simple Images</span> Generic and neutral images are appropriate for a worldwide audience.</li>

        <p>Communication is key! You want your project to get translated without delays or difficulties, and translators want to provide you with accurately translated files. One way to achieve quality translation results is to establish a healthy relationship with your language service provider (LSP) or translator.</p>
        <h2>Establishing Translator Relations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Learn About Your Translator</span> Ideally, you want to find a reliable translation partner who is interested in a long-term business relationship. It is cost-effective to stick with a translator, rather than switch each time you have a translation project to do. It might be beneficial to find a translator who is familiar with Flare.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Communicate With the Translator About the Process</span> Talk about services provided, scheduling, pricing, pre-translation and post translation analysis, project updates during translation, reviewing and editing content, formatting, final delivery of files, etc. Be sure to include the translator in your process.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Talk With the Translator About Your Project</span> If just starting a project, ask for advice on how to best configure it. If your project is established, be sure to explain the project structure to the translator.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Provide Context to the Translator</span> Translators do not know the project like you do, so any contextual resources you can provide helps the translator pinpoint the meaning and tone for translation. Reference materials such as a final PDF of the document, glossary terms, style guide, branding guide, abbreviations, list of terms not for translation, screenshots, notes, or training guide can provide insight.</li>
        </ul>

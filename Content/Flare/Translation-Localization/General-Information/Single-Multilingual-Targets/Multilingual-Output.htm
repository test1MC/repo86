        <p>When translating projects, you can use single language or multilingual output.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/General/Menu-Proxy-Headings-Online-Depth3.flsnp" />
        <h2>Single Language Output</h2>
        <MadCap:microContent id="microcontent2">

            <p>With single language output, one target is generated for each language. In most cases, this means having a separate Flare project for each language, and the target would generate output for that language. A less common situation is where you have one Flare project and a multilingual author is translating content for each language. A unique target for each language would be created and separate output generated for each language.</p>

        <h2>Multilingual Output</h2>
        <MadCap:microContent id="microcontent1">
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Micro-Content-Toolbars/User-Guides/Translation-Localization.flsnp" />
            <p>With multilingual output, one target is generated for multiple languages. There are a couple of ways to do this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Emphasis">Multilingual Targets </span>Each translator provides you with a Flare or Lingo project that contains the translated files. In the original Flare project, you would use the Target Editor's Language tab  to point to each of the translated projects. The generated target combines all of the translations into the same output. See <MadCap:xref href="Creating-Multilingual-Targets.htm">Creating Multilingual Targets</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                <li><span class="Emphasis">Stitching PDFs </span>You drag translated PDFs in different languages into a table of contents (TOC), which serves as an outline for a PDF target. When you generate the PDF target, the result is a single PDF with one language following another. Translated PDFs can also be added to the TOCs for online output. See <MadCap:xref href="Stitching-PDFs2.htm">Stitching PDFs</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            </ul>

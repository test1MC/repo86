        <p>Following are issues that may occur when using condition tags in Flare. </p>
        <div id="madcapToggler" style="min-width:800px">
            <ul class="troubleshooting1">
                <li targets="test1" class="TroubleshootingLink">New condition tags have been set on content but the new tag is not shown</li>
                <li targets="test2" class="TroubleshootingLink">.NET unhandled exception error occurs when attempting to include or exclude a condition tags</li>
            </ul>
            <div targetName="test1" class="troubleshoot">
                <p class="Subheading">New condition tags have been set on content but the new tag is not shown</p>
                <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
                <p>This issue can occur because the window pane or editor needs to be refreshed. </p>
                <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
                <p>Refresh the window pane or editor by bringing it into focus and pressing <span class="Emphasis">F5</span> on the keyboard.</p>
            </div>
            <div targetName="test2" class="troubleshoot">
                <p class="Subheading">.NET unhandled exception error occurs when attempting to include or exclude a condition tags</p>
                <p>A  Microsoft .NET Framework unhandled exception error when attempting to include or exclude a condition tag on a target with a non-alphanumeric character in its name.</p>
                <p class="Subheading">Cause</p>
                <p>This is caused because Flare does not currently support non-alphanumeric names for condition tags. There is currently a bug in Flare's Condition Tag Set Editor which lets you name condition tags with non-alphanumeric characters. The exception error occurs when an attempt to set those conditions on a target in the Target Editor is made.</p>
                <p class="Subheading">Solution</p>
                <p>Refrain from naming conditions in the Condition Tag Set Editor with non-alphanumeric characters until the problem is addressed in a future version. </p>

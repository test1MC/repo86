        <h2>Word Separation</h2>
        <p>Many of your file and folder names are going to consist of more than one word. Here are some ways you can handle this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Hyphens (Recommended) </span>Hyphens provide visible separation between words and are recommended by some search engine optimization (SEO) experts.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Spaces </span>Adding spaces between words is simple. However, blank spaces can cause issues for Web servers, particularly those running UNIX or Linux. Also, in the browser path field, the characters “%20” will be inserted between each word (e.g., Choosing%20a%20Cat.htm instead of, say, Choosing-a-Cat.htm).</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">No Spaces </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-No-Spaces.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Underscores </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-Underscores.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Periods </span>It is recommended that you do not use periods (.) to separate words in file names. Periods are used by some computer systems to indicate different file extension types.</li>
        </ul>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />
        <h2>Case</h2>
        <p>You might choose to uppercase or lowercase in your folder and file names. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-Case.flsnp" /></p>
        <h2>Length</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-Length.flsnp" />
        </p>
        <h2>Key Words or Letters</h2>
        <p>You might consider adding key words or letters at the beginning or end of certain names to make them easily identifiable and organized. For example, perhaps you have created 50 snippets that are specifically intended for a feature called “transmission.” Therefore, you might want to begin the name for each of those snippets with that word (e.g., transmission-getting-started.flsnp, transmission-initial-steps.flsnp, transmission-note-1.flsnp).</p>

        <h2>What the MadCap Documentation Team Does</h2>
        <p>Here is what we do for naming conventions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Hyphens </span>For both file and folder names, we use hyphens between words.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Title Case </span>We use title case when naming our folders and files (e.g., Creating-Project.htm, rather than Creating-project or creating-project.htm).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Length </span>There are some topics that have somewhat long headings out of necessity. However, even in those situations, we try to limit the length of the actual file name, leaving out unnecessary or minor words, such as articles (e.g., Excluding-Javascript-CSH-Calls-HTML5.htm, rather than Excluding-Javascript-for-Context-Sensitive-Help-Calls-in-HTML5-Output.htm).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Keywords and Letters </span>For some file names, we use certain keywords or letters. For example:<ul><li>For snippets that consist solely of an example, we begin the files with the word “Example” (e.g., “Example-Responsive-Content.flsnp,” “Example-Maximum-Concurrent-Builds.flsnp”). It just makes it easier to find and identify them.</li><li>We have many troubleshooting topics that are different from most of our other topics. So we will start the name of each topic with “TS” (e.g., “TS-Condition-Tags.htm,” “TS-PDF-Output.htm”). </li><li>For small images of buttons in the user interface, we add the letters “btn” at the end of the image file name (e.g., “Save-btn.png,” “Search-btn.png,” “Font-btn.png”). This tells us at a glance exactly what kind of an image it is without having to open it.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>

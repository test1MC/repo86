        <h2>What the MadCap Documentation Team Does</h2>
        <p>We store projects locally in each writer’s root C:\ drive for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We wanted the shortest paths possible to our project files. This can make for a smoother experience when the output is integrated into a software application.</li>
            <li>We wanted the paths to be identical for each writer. If we had kept the projects in the default location, each path would have been different for each writer. Having the same path is important when we link to outside files. In our case, we use features such as Global Project Linking, image profiles, and image palettes. Having the same path for all writers makes these processes easier and more streamlined.</li>
            <li>We wanted to keep our permanent project files separate from any temporary project files (stored in the default Documents\Projects folder) that we create for testing purposes.</li>
        </ul>

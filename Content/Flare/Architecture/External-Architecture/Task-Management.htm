        <p>How do you keep track of all the work that you need to accomplish, both inside and outside of a Flare project? The good news is that you have lots of options. The bad news is that it’s not always easy to decide which option is right for you.</p>

        <h2>Management Software Tools</h2>
        <p>Several tools designed to manage issues and tasks are available. This includes applications such as Jira, Trello, and many others.</p>

        <h2>What the MadCap Documentation Team Does</h2>
        <p>At one time, we used Excel spreadsheets and Word documents to keep track of all our work. However, we found that these methods were too manual and cumbersome for us. After tasks and checklists became available in Central, we began to use these features.</p>
        <div class="IndentMedium">
            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            <p>For the most part, we create high-level tasks based on each new feature that is being developed by our programmers. Schedules can be somewhat unpredictable, so we don’t focus much on entering start and due dates. But we do associate each task with a project and assign a writer.</p>
            <p>Also, in the description for each task, we enter the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feature (PBI) number </li>
                <li>Basic explanation of the feature</li>
                <li>Developer lead</li>
                <li>QA lead</li>
                <li>URL to the associated checklist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                </img>
            </p>
            <p>If it is determined that a particular feature will not be part of the upcoming release, but rather a later one, we move the associated task into the backlog.</p>

            <h3>Checklists</h3>
            <p>For each new product release cycle, there are three main types of checklists that we create:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="Emphasis">Release To Do </span>This is a generic checklist with about 25 rows listing certain things that we do, usually in order, throughout each release cycle. The name of the checklist starts with the product name and version number, and it is in ALL CAPS to help it stand out from the many topic checklists that are also listed. We also have detailed notes for each row, which are especially helpful for a new writer. The columns are the names of the writers, who mark each item as complete (if applicable) throughout the course of the release.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Architecture/Architecture-Task-Management2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                </li>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />
                <li>
                    <p><span class="Emphasis">Feature List </span>This is a generic checklist, where each row lists a feature that is part of the upcoming release. The name of the checklist starts with the product name and version number, and it is in ALL CAPS to help it stand out from the many topic checklists that are also listed. A note is included with each feature that provides the URL to the relevant topic checklist. The column are the names of the writers, who mark each item as complete (if applicable) as the feature is finished. There is another column called “Release” that we mark as complete when programmers have made enough progress on the feature to merge the code into their “release” branch (see <MadCap:xref href="Source-Control.htm">Source Control</MadCap:xref>). This tells us that we may safely merge the documentation for that feature into our “release” branch as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Architecture/Architecture-Task-Management3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                    <p>Essentially, this checklist is a consolidation of the tasks that were created for the upcoming release. We’ve found that is nice to have this “birds-eye” view of all the features intended for the next release. And if it turns out that a particular feature does not make it into the specified release, we edit the checklist, removing that row.</p>
                </li>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />
                <li>
                    <p><span class="Emphasis">Topics </span>This is a project files checklist. It is the most detailed, and perhaps the most important, of our checklist types. For each feature, we create one of these topic checklists. The checklist name includes the product name and version number (or release date). Within the checklist, we choose the Flare topics that are new or affected by that feature. Columns indicate (in order, for the most part), the various things we want to ensure are completed for each topic (e.g., Edit, TOCs, Index, CSH ID, Reviewed). As needed, we enter notes for a particular topic to remind us of specific things that might need to be done (e.g., “Replace video link”).</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Architecture/Architecture-Task-Management4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because each of these types of checklists is used repeatedly over time, we have created checklist templates so that we don’t need to manually re-enter all of the columns, rows, and notes each time we create a new checklist.</p>

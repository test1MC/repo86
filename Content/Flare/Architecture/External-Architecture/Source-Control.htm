        <p>It might be tempting for some authoring teams to want to put a Flare project up on a network drive and simply let multiple authors open and work in it. However, this is not recommended. First, working on projects on a remote server, rather than locally on your computer, can result in lag time and poor performance. And perhaps more importantly, this type of work situation can result in conflicts that never get resolved (e.g., two writers work on the same file, and one writer’s changes overwrite the other’s). That is why a source control solution is highly recommended, especially when multiple writers are working in the same project.</p>

        <h2>Source Control Tools</h2>
        <p>Source control isn’t built in to Flare, but you can integrate a Flare project with a third-party source control tool. There are several third-party source control tools on the market, such as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>
                <p>Perforce Helix Core</p>
            </li>
            <li>Subversion</li>
            <li>Team Foundation Server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As an alternative to these source control tools, authors can use MadCap Central, which employs Git behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>Central offers a single-bound model, where your projects work directly with Central to manage source control.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/Ce-Fl/Source-Control/Single-Bound2.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />
        <p>Central also offers a dual-bound model. With this model, you can continue to use your third-party source control tool, as well as create a secondary binding to Central.</p>

        <h2>Branching</h2>
        <p>Branching is a feature of some source control tools where you can work on different versions of the same project. It’s a way of engaging in parallel development, in which you can keep your new development separate from the finished documentation. Git’s method of branching is particularly powerful.</p>
        <p>Although it might not be used by the majority of authors, branching is a feature in some source control tools that can be extremely useful, especially when you are working with an Agile methodology.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #242729;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You might have a master branch, which is a version of your project the last time you published output.</p>
            <p>You also might have a release branch of your project, which is a version of your project for the next, upcoming publication of your output.</p>
            <p>Then you might have several feature branches, each one where you have a version of your project dedicated to a new feature you’re working on. And when you’re certain that a particular feature will be part of the next release, you merge it into your release branch, and finally into the master branch. Changes can also be merged back into ongoing feature branches so that they have the latest content from other branches.</p>

This can help limit the conflicts that occur and make it less daunting when you need to resolve them.</p>

        <h2><a name="WhatMadCapDocTeamDoes"></a>What the MadCap Documentation Team Does</h2>
        <p>We use source control for all of our projects, but we do it in slightly different ways for each.</p>
        <div class="IndentMedium">
            <h3>Shared</h3>
            <p>Our main Shared project is bound to Git, and we use Visual Studio as the interface to manage files. The key reason we use Git is its branching capabilities, and we use a system called “GitFlow,” which makes our workflow easier to manage. In addition, we uploaded our Shared project to MadCap Central in order to build and publish output, so that means we have a dual-bound source control structure. Therefore, we work normally in Flare, pulling and pushing commits in our first binding via Visual Studio. Then periodically, one author pushes the changes up to Central so that the latest files are available for generation and publication.</p>
            <p>The reason we don’t just use a single-bound model for the “Shared” project is that Central does not yet support branching. When it does support it in the future, we will most likely drop the first binding and use source control directly between the Flare project and Central.</p>
            <h3>Documentation Bible</h3>
            <p>Our Documentation Bible project does not require any branching like our Shared project does. Therefore, we use the simpler single-bound source control structure where this project is bound to Central and no other tool. When authors need to work in the Documentation Bible project, they synchronize it with the cloned project on Central.</p>
            <h3>"Develop" Projects</h3>
            <p>Our “Develop” projects also use the single-bound model with MadCap Central as the source control solution. The single-bound model is used because we don’t need to use branching with our “Develop” projects. That’s because all of the branching is done beforehand in the main “Shared” project. These “Develop” projects are the result of Global Project Linking, where miniature copies of the main “Shared” project are created.</p>
            <p>So when we use branching in our main “Shared” project, we have a special branch called “develop.” It’s basically a version of our main “Shared” project that acts sort of like a sandbox. It contains most of the new documentation that’s in a state of development. All of our “Develop” child projects are based on this “develop” branch.</p>
            <p>Therefore, these “Develop” projects let us see files as the project is in a state of development. And because of that, we use these projects for things such as the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tasks</li>
                <li>Checklists</li>
                <li>Reviews</li>
                <li>Internal outputs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So why don’t we just use our main “Shared” project—which is also uploaded to Central—to work with tasks, checklists, and so on, instead of creating multiple child projects from it? The answer is branching. At this time, Central only lets you push changes from the “master” branch of any project. And the master branch is the latest version of our documentation that is released to the public; it does not contain any ongoing edits for future releases. Therefore, creating tasks and checklists based on the master branch of our main “Shared” project doesn’t make sense, since task and checklists have to do with ongoing and future documentation.</p>

        <p>You can use "Sort As" links for glossaries. This is similar to using "Sort As"&#160;index links (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Indexes/Main-Activities/Creating-Index-Links.htm">Creating Index Links</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Glossaries/Sort-As-Summary.flsnp" />
        <p>When your glossary is displayed in the output (e.g., the Glossary window pane for Tripane output), by default terms are shown alphabetically. However, you can use the "Sort As" field in the Properties dialog to force a particular term to be displayed where you want it. This is especially useful if you are using "Sort As"&#160;links in your index, and you want words that appear in both places to be sorted in the same way.</p>

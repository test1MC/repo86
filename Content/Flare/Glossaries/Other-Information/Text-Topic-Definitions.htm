        <p>The definition for a term can be simple text, which you supply at the same time that you create the glossary term. However, you can also create a topic specifically for a definition (with any formatting or elements that you might apply to a regular topic). The term can then be linked to that topic, instead of linking it to a simple text definition.</p>

        <h2>Glossary Integration With Search</h2>

            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">In order for a glossary term to display in the search results, the end user's search text must match the glossary term exactly, with no additional words (although it is not case-sensitive). For example, in the example above, only the word "table" was included in the search; therefore, the glossary term "Table" was displayed. But if we had searched for "table topic," no glossary term would have been displayed in the search results.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can enable or disable this feature in the HTML5 Target Editor by selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Search</span> tab, choosing <span class="Emphasis">MadCap Search</span>, and clicking <span class="Emphasis">Include Glossary Results</span>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Search/Search-Results-Options/Including-Glossary-Terms-Search-Result.htm">Including Glossary Terms in Search Results</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        </p>
        <p>If you open an HTML5 Side Navigation, Top Navigation, Tripane, or Search Results skin, you will notice Search Glossary styles that let you control the look of this new feature (e.g., change the font color to make it stand out from the other search results). The Search Glossary Result style is used to control the entire area displaying the glossary search result. The Search Glossary Term and Search Glossary Definition styles are used to control the look of only the term and definition, respectively. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Skins/HTML5-Skin-Styles/Search-Results-HTML5-Skins.htm">Search Results in HTML5 Skins</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h2>Search Field in Glossary Pane</h2>
        <p>A search field is automatically added to the top of the Glossary pane in <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" /> output (Tripane only, not Side Navigation, Top Navigation, or skinless outputs). When you begin typing in the search field, Flare eliminates all other terms not matching what you type. So you end up with a much shorter group of matching terms. To return to the original full view of the glossary, just clear the search field.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You have a glossary that looks like this:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Glossaries/Glossary-Search1.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>If you type the word "target," the view will change to this:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Glossaries/Glossary-Search2.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>You can customize or hide this field. This includes the ability to change the following on the Styles tab of the Skin Editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Skins/HTML5-Skin-Styles/Navigation-HTML5-Skins.htm">Navigation in HTML5 Skins</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>By default, partial-word searching is enabled. This means that as a user types a search phrases, results are automatically displayed and the matching text is highlighted, even if the search text is only part of the glossary term. However, on the General tab of the Skin Editor, you can disable this feature. You might do this to improve performance. If you do this, results are no longer highlighted as users enter search text.

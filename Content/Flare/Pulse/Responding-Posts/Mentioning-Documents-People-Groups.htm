        <p>All registered users can use the Mentions feature to mention other registered users by name in status updates, questions, articles, and comments. If users have added documents or groups to Pulse, you can also insert mentions to those items. </p>
        <p>Like many popular social media sites, this feature lets you type the @&#160;sign and then start typing the name of a document, person, or group to insert a mention. This is a useful tool for building social relationships. It lets you express interest in others by highlighting a user in conversation. Its also a great way to highlight a document, thank a group for their contribution, or just say congratulations on a job well done.</p>

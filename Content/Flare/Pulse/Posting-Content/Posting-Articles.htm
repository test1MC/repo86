        <p>All registered users can create and post articles in the topic feeds associated with a Pulse system. The most common place for end users to create articles is in a topic feed (i.e., the embedded discussion form that appears under each topic in the Flare output).  However, you can also post articles in any group, tag, or user feed that you have access permission to view.</p>

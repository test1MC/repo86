        <p>All registered users can respond to task assignments posted in the topic feeds associated with a Pulse system (i.e., the embedded discussions forms that appear at the bottom of each topic in the Flare output). </p>
        <p>If you have not been assigned a task, the list below describes each available response that is available. Members of the Customers and Employees group can edit tasks, with the exception of the&#160;Tags field. When tasks are changed, Pulse sends a notification to the task owner. </p>

You can use the Target Editor to switch the output type for a particular target. You can also add an internal comment to describe the output.

It will display automatically after you build the target. However, if you have added more browse sequences, you need to specify which one will serve as the primary browse sequence. This is the browse sequence that will be displayed in the output. The additional browse sequences will also be displayed if you have linked to them from the primary browse sequence. You can use the Target Editor to associate a primary browse sequence with a target.

                                        <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Disable Auto-Sync </span>Let's say you have imported <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Word" />, Adobe FrameMaker, or Flare files from another project, and when doing so, you selected the "Easy Sync" option to automatically reimport the files when you generate output. You can use this feature to override that Easy Sync setting for a specific target. Therefore, if you want to reimport any of the files, you will need to do so manually. You might decide to use this option, for example, if you are testing the generation of output and do not want to wait the extra time for the files to be imported. After you finish your testing, you can deselect this option to return to the automatic imports of the files. See <MadCap:xref href="Disabling-Auto-Sync-Import-Files1.htm">Disabling Auto-Sync of Import Files</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</li>

                                        <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Associate Skin </span>A skin is a file that contains information about the appearance of the output window. After you add a skin to your project and edit the settings, you can associate it with a target. When you build the target, the output will be displayed in the skin. You can also tell Flare not to use any skin at all. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Skins/Process/Associating-Skins-Targets1.htm">Associating Skins With Targets</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                                        <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Associate Skin Components </span>In addition to or instead of full skins, you can use smaller skin components for features such as search, menus, and toolbars. If you add multiple skin components of the same type to your project, you can associate one with a target. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Skins/Other-Activities/General/Associating-Skin-Components-Targets.htm">Associating Skin Components With Targets</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                                        <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Set Responsive Output </span>For HTML5 skins, you can override the responsive output settings from the Skin Editor for Tripane skins. Top Navigation skins automatically have responsive output enabled, so you can use the fields in the Target Editor to control the widths for the different mediums. In addition, you can choose to use device width media queries, which means the output will be responsive based on the actual device rather than merely on the width of the screen.

After you create a publishing destination, you need to associate it with a target that you plan to build. You can associate the same publishing destination with as many targets as you want.

                                        <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Enable HTML5 Server-Based Output </span>You can create <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" /> output in its regular state, or you can select an option in the Publishing tab of the Target Editor to enable server-based functionality. This lets you accomplish the same results as <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Plus" /> output—searching of non-XHTML content, faster server-side search, and automatic runtime merging.

In most cases, this will be <span class="Emphasis">Web</span>, which is the default value. However, if you or someone in your company (e.g., network administrator) creates a custom catalog, you need to enter that name in the field.

This can be done when you are first creating the project or later by using the Project Properties option. You can also override the project language and set it for the individual targets or topics. If out want to create a multilingual target output, you can select multiple languages and link Lingo projects or additional Flare projects to your current (parent) project. The generated output will include each selected language. In addition, if you set a right-to-left (RTL) language on the target, there are multiple options selected by default. These options are used to automatically invert language-related style rules locally or in the stylesheet, as well as to invert image callouts and page layout settings.

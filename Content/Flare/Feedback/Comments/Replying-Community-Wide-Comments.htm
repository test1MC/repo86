        <h2>How to Reply to a Comment Publicly From the Notification Email</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the email click the <span class="Emphasis">Reply</span> link.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Feedback/Reply-Email-Administrator.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>A window opens with the original comment and a field for you to reply.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span>.</p>
                <p>Your comment displayed under the original comment in the output for all of your readers to see. </p>
                <p>This method is especially useful if you have set up comment so that they require approval. If you view the original comment and your reply in Feedback Explorer, you will notice that the status of each comment has been set to Accepted.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Even if you are an administrator, you must first be a registered user of the output (even your own output) in order to use this email reply feature. This means that you may need to add your first comment from the output itself, or at least click the Edit User Profile button <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Interface/Buttons/Edit-User-Profile-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> (if included in the output). You do not need to select the notification check boxes in your user profile if you are also set up as an administrator. See <MadCap:xref href="Editing-Feedback-Profiles.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Editing Feedback Profiles</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h2>How to Reply to a Comment by Navigating to a Topic</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If necessary, accept the comment from the reader in the email you received or in Feedback Explorer. </li>
            <li>Open the topic in your published online output (just as your end users would).</li>
            <li>Find and select the comment to which you want to reply.</li>
            <li>At the bottom of the topic click the <span class="Emphasis">Reply to Comment</span> button <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/Interface/Buttons/Reply-Comment-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. The Reply to Comment dialog opens.</li>
            <li>Enter a subject and a comment. </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span>. </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you have set up comments so that they require approval, you need to open Feedback Explorer and approve your own comment (or you can approve it from the email notification sent to you). </p>
                <p>The comment will then be displayed under the original comment in the output for all of your readers to see. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Reply to a Comment Privately</h2>
        <ol>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">If you do not done so already, open the configured FBCONF file in Feedback Explorer. </li>
            <li>View the comment (select <span class="Emphasis">View &gt; Comments</span>), and make note of the individual's user name. </li>
            <li>View the list of active users (select <span class="Emphasis">View &gt; Active Users</span>). </li>
            <li>In the Active Users window pane, find the user and the corresponding email address in the list.</li>
            <li>Send the user an email with your response to the comment.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">When testing Feedback, make sure you are entering comments in the output that you generate, rather than in the Feedback incorporated into Flare. Otherwise, the comments will be sent to the Flare Documentation Team, rather than to you.</p>

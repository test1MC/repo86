        <h2>How to Customize Which Segments are Shown in the Window Pane</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>View the frequent segments. See <MadCap:xref href="Viewing-Frequent-Segments.htm">Viewing Frequent Segments</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>In the local toolbar of the Frequent Segments window pane, click <span class="Emphasis">Search Properties</span>.The Frequent Segment Search Properties dialog opens.</li>
            <li>Adjust any of the fields in the dialog.<ul><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Min Word Count </span>Use this field to set the minimum number of words that must be contained in a segment in order for it to be displayed in the Frequent Segments window pane.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Max Word Count </span>Use this field to set the maximum number of words that can be contained in a segment in order for it to be displayed in the Frequent Segments window pane. The highest number you can enter is 30. If you want to convert content containing more than 30 words to snippets, you can use <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to find multiple instances of partial content. Then you need to open Flare and manually replace the large chunks of content with snippets.</li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Min Segment Count </span>Use this field to set the minimum number of times that a segment must occur throughout a project in order for it to be displayed in the Frequent Segments window pane.</li></ul></li>

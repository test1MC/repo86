        <p>You can browse and select folders containing files that you want to share among <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> projects. When you bring folders into the External Resources window pane, this does not mean that they are automatically part of your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project; it simply means that they are available to become part of a project and to be synchronized with the source files residing elsewhere.</p>

        <h2>How to Add Folders to the External Resources Window Pane</h2>

        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">After you add folders to the External Resources window pane, you can open the files within them. You can also copy any of the files to your project, mapping them to the source files at the same time. See <MadCap:xref href="Opening-External-Resource-Files.htm">Opening External Resource Files</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Copying-Mapping-External-Resource-Files.htm">Copying and Mapping External Resource Files</MadCap:xref>.</p>

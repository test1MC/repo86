        <p> After you add folders and files to the External Resources window pane, you can open files to edit them. You have a couple of options. </p>
        <p>Most likely you will want to open <i>copies</i> of the external files in your project (if you are using file mappings and synchronization). See <MadCap:xref href="Copying-Mapping-External-Resource-Files.htm">Copying and Mapping External Resource Files</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing-External-Resource-Files.htm">Synchronizing External Resource Files</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>Alternatively you can open the <i>actual source file</i> existing outside of your project. </p>
        <p>For more information about your options for working with external resource files, see <MadCap:xref href="External-Resources.htm">About External Resources</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <li>
                <p>All copies of external resource files that you added to your project will be located somewhere in the Content folder (in the root itself or under subfolders where you may have placed files when copying them to <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />). Locate the file that you want to open. You can use the "multi-view" to do this.</p>

                        <p>Right-click the file and select <span class="Emphasis">Open</span>. You can also select <span class="Emphasis">Open with</span> and choose the appropriate application.</p>
                        <p>OR</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Click on the file, and in the local toolbar click <img class="ReduceButtonSize" src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl-Li/Interface/Buttons/Open-btn.png" />.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application.</p>

        <p>After you open a file, you can edit it as necessary and save your changes. </p>
        <p>If you have opened a copy of an external resource file and you have mapped it to the source file outside of your project, you might want to synchronize your files. See <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing-External-Resource-Files.htm">Synchronizing External Resource Files</MadCap:xref>.</p>

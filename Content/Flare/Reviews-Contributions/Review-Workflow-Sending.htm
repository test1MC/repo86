            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The following describes a workflow where you have decided to simply save review packages to a network drive (rather than using the built-in email transfer method).</p>
            <p>In Flare, you open one of the topics that you want to send for review. From the <span class="Emphasis">Review</span> ribbon, you select <span class="Emphasis">Send for Review</span>.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>The topic is listed in the wizard that opens, but you want to include more topics, so you click <img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Fl-Li/Interface/Buttons/Plus-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" alt="" /> and select them.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example2.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example3.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Then, you select <span class="Emphasis">Send a review package file</span> (since you are using Contributor instead of Central).</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example4.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Selecting "Next" would let you set up emails to send the review package. However, instead of this, you want to save the review package on a shared network drive where your reviewers can access it. So you click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> and choose the location.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example5.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Let's say you have two reviewers. Unlike Central, Contributor does not allow multiple reviewers to a file at the same time. So you send an email to the first reviewer with a link to the review package location, and ask her to open that review package and give you feedback. The idea is that you will deal with one reviewer at a time until you have changes and feedback from both.</p>
            <p>The first reviewer double-clicks the review package file in the network folder, opening it in Contributor.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example6.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>The topics in the review package are listed in a grid at the bottom of Contributor. The reviewer opens each one, making edits (which are automatically tracked) and inserting annotations (comments). The tracked changes can be seen when the <span class="Emphasis">Changes</span> option is selected on the Review ribbon.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example7.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>When finished with all of the files, the reviewer saves her changes. If you were using the integrated email method, the reviewer would click Return to Sender in the Review Packages window pane at this point. But since you are not using that feature, the reviewer simply sends you an email or message (however you normally communicate), and lets you know she is finished.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example8.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>Then, you do the same with the second reviewer, asking him to open the review package and give you feedback. He does the same thing as the first reviewer and lets you know when he's finished.</p>
            <p>In Flare, you select <span class="Emphasis">Review &gt; File Reviews</span>. If you had used the built-in email feature, the review files would display automatically in the inbox of the File Reviews window pane. But since you saved the review package to a location, you select <span class="Emphasis">Import Review Package</span>, then find and select the review package file.</p>
            <p>From the File Reviews window pane, you open each of the files. The tab and local toolbar in the editor lets you know that you are looking at the reviewed file, rather than the original file that you sent out.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example9.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>You accept or reject the changes, and either delete the annotations or keep them for future reference.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example10.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>When you are finished with each file, you save your work. Then you click <img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Ce-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Accept-Topic-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />, which accepts the reviewed file back into the Flare project, replacing the original file.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Package-Example11.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
            </p>
            <p>After you've done this with all of the files, the Inbox in the File Reviews window pane should be empty (unless there are other review packages that haven't been dealt with yet).</p>

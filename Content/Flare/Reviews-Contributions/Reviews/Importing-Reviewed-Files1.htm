        <p>You can import reviewed files (topics and snippets) into the inbox of the File Reviews window pane. After that, you can view and/or accept the file. You might use this feature, for example, if you have received a file from a reviewer, but rather than immediately sending the file to your inbox from the email message, you saved it to a folder on your computer or a network drive.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> For an example of one workflow, see <MadCap:xref href="../Review-Workflow-Sending.htm">Review Workflow—Sending to Others</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only"> For an example of one workflow, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Print-Only-Topics/Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Review-Workflow-Sending.htm">Review Workflow—Sending to Others</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

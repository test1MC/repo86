            <MadCap:concept term="FilterFeatures" />Topics and the XML Editor</h1>
        <p>When you need to create or edit content for your documentation, the XML Editor is the primary authoring editor that you interact with. The tools that you can use, and the tasks that you can do in the editor make the authoring easy. For example, you can take advantage of the local toolbar buttons, view different layouts, collapse or expand tags, or insert bookmarks, conditions, links, images, and more.</p>
        <p>One thing to be aware of about the editor  is that it inherently includes the XML markup language.  You don't need to know anything about XML to author topics, but it is this behind the scenes XML structure that provides the many benefits for rendering content in different outputs.</p>

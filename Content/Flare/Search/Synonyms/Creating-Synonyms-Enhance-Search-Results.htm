        <p>Following are steps for creating synonyms.</p>
        <h2>How to Create Synonyms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Do one of the following to add or open a synonym file:</li>
            <p class="Subheading">To Add a Synonym File</p>
            <ol class="LowerAlpha">
                <li>If you have not done so already, add a synonym file to the project. Start by selecting <span class="Emphasis">Project &gt; New &gt; Advanced &gt; Synonym File</span> (if using ribbon view) or <span class="Emphasis">Project &gt; Advanced &gt; Synonym File</span> (if using menu view). </li>
                <li>Enter a name for the synonym file and click <span class="Emphasis">Add</span>.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>
                <p class="Subheading">To Open a Synonym File</p>
            </li>
            <ol class="LowerAlpha">
                <li>
                    <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/General/Open-Project-Organizer.flsnp" />
                </li>
                <li>Double-click the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced</span> folder.</li>
                <li>Double-click the synonym file.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Synonyms Editor, you can create directional synonyms or synonym groups for single words.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The synonyms feature supports the use of single words only. You cannot use phrases with the synonyms feature. For example, you cannot create a synonym named "tool bar" for the word "toolbar." An example of a valid use of the synonyms feature would be to add the synonym "hound" for the word "dog" or "kitty" for the word "cat." </p>
                </div>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Search-Guide" />
                <p class="Subheading">
                    <MadCap:keyword term="Synonyms:groups" />Synonym Group</p>
                <MadCap:microContent id="microcontent1">
                    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Micro-Content-Toolbars/Cheat-Sheets-User-Guides/Search.flsnp" />
                    <p>This is a collection of synonyms that produces the same search results for all of the words in the group. It is a useful method if you have multiple terms in your project that are similar, and you want the same search results to be returned when users enter any of those phrases. In the Synonyms Editor, you enter the terms with an equal sign between each one (Synonym1=Synonym2=Synonym3). When users enter any of those terms in future searches, all topics containing any of those words are found.</p>
                </MadCap:microContent>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You have written some content about sports, and many of your topics include the words "sports," "athletics," or "games." If a user enters the word "athletics" as the search term, it will return not only topics containing that word, but also topics containing the words "sports" or "games" (even if "athletics" does not occur in those other topics).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="IndentMedium">
                    <p class="Subheading">To Create a Synonym Group</p>
                    <ol class="LowerAlpha">
                        <li>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Groups</span> tab.</li>
                        <li>Click in the empty <span class="Emphasis">Group</span> cell and press <span class="Emphasis">F2</span> on your keyboard.</li>
                        <li>Type the words that you want to include in the group, with an equal sign between each (e.g., sports=athletics=games). Press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span> when you are finished.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>(Optional) Click in the <span class="Emphasis">Stem</span> check box if you want Flare to find other variations of the synonyms that have the same stems.example.</p>
                            <div class="example">
                                <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You enter "hike=walk" in the Group cell. Then you select the Stem check box. In the future, if users search for the word "hike," it will find all topics containing the words "hike" or "walk." However, it will also find topics containing words that have the same stem as those terms, such as "hiked," "hiking," or "walking."</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Search-Guide" />
                <p class="Subheading">
                    <MadCap:keyword term="Synonyms:directional;Directional synonyms" />Directional Synonym</p>
                <MadCap:microContent id="microcontent2">
                    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Micro-Content-Toolbars/Cheat-Sheets-User-Guides/Search.flsnp" />
                    <p>This is a synonym that works in one direction (Word—&gt;Synonym). It is a useful method if readers enter a search term that is not contained in your project, but you have a similar word that is contained in the project. It works like this… In the Synonyms Editor, you enter the word that is not producing search results (because it <i>is not contained</i> in your project content). Next to it, you enter a synonym—a word that will produce search results (because it <i>is contained</i> in your project content). When users enter the original word again in future searches, topics containing the synonym are found.</p>
                </MadCap:microContent>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You use Central Analytics to view search keyword results from your users and find that many are entering the search term "sofa." Unfortunately, you have not used that word in your project, so users are unable to find the topics that they need. However, you have used a similar word, "couch." Therefore, in the Synonyms Editor, you enter "couch" as a synonym for "sofa." The next time a reader enters "sofa" as a search keyword, topics containing the word "couch" will be returned in the results.</p>

In the future, when users perform a search and enter the term from the Word cell (e.g., sofa), Flare will find all topics that contain the term that you entered in the Synonym cell (e.g., couch).</p>

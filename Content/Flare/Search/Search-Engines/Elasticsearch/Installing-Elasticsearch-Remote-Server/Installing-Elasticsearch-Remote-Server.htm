        <p>Before you can publish HTML5 output to use Elasticsearch, you must have a remote server configured to run the Elasticsearch service as well as the Content Services web application. The Elasticsearch service is required to perform searches from the indexed search data.  The Content Services Portal  is provided as a central location to manage the search data published from Flare.  </p>

The procedure typically requires administrator permissions. If you are unfamiliar with how to install a web server, it is highly recommended to contact your Network Administrator for assistance.</p>

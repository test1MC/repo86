        <h2>About N-Grams</h2>
        <p>In the English language, sentences are composed of a sequence of words. Because English words are separated by spaces, search engines have a reliable pattern for detecting word boundaries when retrieving search results. In other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and&#160;Korean, spaces are not used to separate words. This makes the task of retrieving accurate matches for these languages more challenging for search engines.</p>
        <p>To address this issue efficiently, the search database can be set to use the n-gram model to help it more accurately predict word patterns. This improves the search feature's ability to retrieve accurate search results for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages.</p>

        <h2>How to Set the N-Gram Size</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Project Organizer, open the desired target.</li>
            <li>In the Target Editor, click the <span class="Emphasis">Search</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Expand the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Search Options</span> section.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">N-gram size</span> box, select a value between 1- 5. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">Typically, the default value of one&#160;(1)&#160;is optimal for most projects.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p class="Tip-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed420;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Applying an n-gram value to a project affects the size of the search database. It also affects the quantity and accuracy of the search results. In general, lower n-gram values (e.g., 1-2) result in a smaller database. As a result, end user search queries will typically retrieve a higher number results with less accurate matches. Similarly, larger n-gram values (e.g., 4-5) result in a larger database. Therefore, search queries will typically retrieve a smaller number of results with more accurate matches.</p>

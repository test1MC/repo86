        <p>The search features and capabilities that are available in your published Flare output depend on the output type. In addition, you can perform search queries using different search methods and syntax when you publish client- or server-based output:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Search and Client-Based Output </span>With the web-based output types, search operations are supported by a Flare search database. This database&#160;consists of an array of JavaScript and XML&#160;files that are built and published with the Flare output in the Data folder. With <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTMLHelp" />, the Microsoft Compiled HTML&#160;(CHM) Help file format  also offers a built-in search engine.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:microContent id="microcontent1">
                    <div>
                        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Micro-Content-Toolbars/Cheat-Sheets-User-Guides/Search.flsnp" />
                        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Search and Server-Based Output </span>There are multiple search options to choose from for online output, including server-based search options.   For example, the <a href="../../Step4-Developing-Targets/Output-Types/HTML5-Output/General-Information/HTML5-Key-Features.htm#ServerBasedOutput" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">server-based  HTML5 output type</a> can be enabled in Flare, and then published to an Internet Information Services (IIS) server. For these outputs, search operations are supported by the Microsoft Indexing Service or Windows Search.</p>
                        <p>However, you do not need to use HTML5 server-based output to have server-based search. We recommend that you use <a href="../Search-Engines/Elasticsearch/Elasticsearch.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Elasticsearch</a> with regular HTML5 output to produce server-based search. Elasticsearch includes features such as search auto-complete with suggestions.</p>

                        <h2>Global Dictionary</h2>
                        <p>A global dictionary is a file that contains words and can be used for spell checking by any <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project you open on your computer. <span class="topic-only">This is a convenient way to ensure that all of your projects are using the same spellings for terms, rather than having each project rely on a different dictionary.</span></p>

                        </p>
                        <p>However, you can use the Spelling tab of the Options dialog  (<span class="Emphasis">File &gt; Options</span>) to <a href="../Main-Activities/Choosing-Location-Global-Dictionaries.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">choose another location for your global dictionary</a>. For example, you might be working with a team of writers and want to make sure you are all using the same spellings for certain terms. By choosing a network directory, your entire team can use the same global dictionary. </p>

                        <h2>Project Dictionary</h2>
                        <p>A project dictionary is unique to a particular project. It is automatically created and added to the Advanced folder in the Project Organizer.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>For example, you might choose to use this kind of dictionary if you are a writer with several clients, and each client has unique terms with unusual spellings. By using a project dictionary, you can keep those spellings tied to a certain project.</p>

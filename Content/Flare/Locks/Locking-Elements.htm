        <p>You can lock areas within topics, such as paragraphs, so that they cannot be edited. You might take advantage of this feature, for example, when you are using <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s file review and contributions process<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../Reviews-Contributions/Reviews-Contributions.htm">About  Reviews and Contributions</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. If you want a reviewer to see portions of a file, but you do not want that individual to alter them, you can lock those parts. After the file is returned, you can unlock those areas of the file. See <MadCap:xref href="Unlocking-Elements.htm">Unlocking Elements</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>When you mark areas in a file to be locked, the background of that area turns gray. However, you can turn this background on or off, depending on whether you want to see it when working on the file.</p>

        <h2>How to Lock Elements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/Co-Fl-Li/Topics/Open-Content-File.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="mc-locked: unlocked;">Place your cursor on a paragraph that you want to lock, or highlight multiple paragraphs.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Only entire blocks of content or paragraphs can be locked, not portions of paragraphs.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Review &gt; Lock &gt; Lock</b>.</p>
                <p>The paragraphs display a gray background, which will not show up in the output.</p>
                <p>If you want to hide this shading from the XML Editor, but still keep the locks on the paragraphs, select <span class="Emphasis">Review &gt; Lock &gt; Show Locked Elements</span> (in the ribbon view). You can also click the down arrow next to the <span class="Emphasis">Show tags</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Show-Tags-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the XML Editor. Then select <span class="Emphasis">Show Locked Elements</span>.</p>
                <p>Notice that you can still click in the paragraphs and edit the text. That is because the elements have only been marked for locking, but they have not yet been locked.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Review &gt; Lock &gt; Enable Locks</b>.</p>
                <p>The paragraphs marked for locking are now locked, and you cannot edit the text within them.</p>
            </li>

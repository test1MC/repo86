            </li>
            <li>The Delete dialog opens. Select the bound files you want to delete.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Delete</span>. The files are removed from your project and from the source control repository. Files that are deleted from projects bound to Git cannot be undeleted.</p>

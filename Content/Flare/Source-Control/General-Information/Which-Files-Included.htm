        <h2>If Including Files Manually in Your Source Control Client</h2>
        <p>If you are manually adding files to a source control application (rather than using the built-in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> integration), you can transfer any appropriate files in a <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. Appropriate files include the following.</p>

        <h2>If Using the Source Control Integration in the Flare Interface</h2>
        <p>If you are using <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s built-in source control integration, you can transfer the following types of files.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Source-Control/FAQ-Which-Files4.flsnp" />
        <p>In most workflows, you only need to transfer the content and project files mentioned, and when you are ready to generate output, you would publish the output files to another location where users can access them (such as a website or network drive). However, if you want to use Flare to directly publish your output to source control so you can keep a copy of your finished output for future reference, you can also create a source control publishing destination. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Step5-Building-Publishing-Output/Publishing-Destinations/Process/Creating-Destination-File-Source-Control.htm">Creating Destination Files Using Source Control</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

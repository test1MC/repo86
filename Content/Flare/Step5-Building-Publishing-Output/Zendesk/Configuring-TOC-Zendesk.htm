        <p>When you first activate your Zendesk dashboard,  there are default categories and sections already created. You can use these categories and sections if it aligns with the TOC you are using to publish to Zendesk. Otherwise, you should create your own categories and sections that better align with your TOC.</p>

        <h2>Using TOC to Define Categories and Sections</h2>
        <p>If you are using the TOC to define your categories and sections in Zendesk, keep the following rules in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top-level books in your TOC are converted to categories alongside any categories already created.</li>
            <li>Topics that are linked to top-level books are published to the default category and section.</li>
            <li>Top-level topics are published to the default category and section. No additional categories are created for the top-level topics.</li>
            <li>Second-level topics are converted to sections.</li>
            <li>Any topics linked to second-level books in your TOC are published as articles to that section.</li>
            <li>How third-level and lower-level books are treated depends on whether you create sub-sections. See <MadCap:xref href="#CreatingSubSections">Creating Sub-Sections</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using TOC to Define Sections</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Top-level books in your TOC are converted to sections.</li>
            <li>Topics that are linked to top-level books are published as articles in that section.</li>
            <li>Top-level topics are converted into sections and also included as articles in that newly created section.</li>
            <li>How second-level and lower-level books are treated depends on whether you create sub-sections. See <MadCap:xref href="#CreatingSubSections">Creating Sub-Sections</MadCap:xref>.</li>

        <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Any topics that are not in the TOC—regardless if they are linked to topics in the TOC—are published to the default category and section configured in the destination file.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Any topics that reside in the third level or lower in your TOC will be published as articles on the same level in Zendesk, unless you enable the option to create sub-sections and you are publishing to a Zendesk guide that supports sub-sections. Without sub-sections, there are only three levels in Zendesk: categories, sections, and articles. With the sub-sections option enabled, you can have categories, sections, sub-sections, and articles; therefore, you might have four or more levels (with nested sub-sections).</p>
            </li>
            <li>Any categories and sections that are generated during publishing are added to Zendesk Help Center in the same order they are displayed in the TOC. This also applies to multilingual projects.</li>

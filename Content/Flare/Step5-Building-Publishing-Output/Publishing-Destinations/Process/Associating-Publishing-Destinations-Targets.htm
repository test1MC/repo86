            <li>Double-click the <span class="Emphasis">Targets</span> folder. The existing targets are shown. </li>
            <li>Double-click the target that you want to associate with the destination. The target opens in its own page in the Target Editor.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Publishing</span> tab. All publishing destinations that have been added to the project are displayed. If a destination contains a check mark next to it, that means it is associated with the target. If it does not contain a check mark, it is not yet associated with the target.</li>
            <li>Click the check box in the <span class="Emphasis">Publish </span>column next to any destinations that you want to associate with the target. A check mark appears next to any destinations that you select. </li>

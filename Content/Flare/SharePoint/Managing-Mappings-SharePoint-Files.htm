        <p>If you copy SharePoint files to your project, you can create mappings (connections) between the copies of those files that you bring into your project and the source files on the SharePoint server. You can do this at the point that you copy those files into your project (see <MadCap:xref href="Copying-Mapping-SharePoint-Files.htm">Copying and Mapping SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>). You can also manage these mappings whenever necessary through the Map Files and Folders dialog. This involves the ability to create, change, or remove mappings.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">After you map project files to source files located on the SharePoint server, you can synchronize them to ensure that each file contains the same content. This process lets you import content from SharePoint files, export content from files in the project, or keep the most recently modified content. See <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing-SharePoint-Files.htm">Synchronizing SharePoint Files and Folders</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <p> After connecting to a SharePoint server, you can open files to edit them. </p>
        <p>One option is that you can open the <i>actual SharePoint files</i> that exist on the server (if you decide, for example, to use the check-out/check-in features). See <MadCap:xref href="Checking-Out-SharePoint-Files.htm">Checking Out SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Checking-In-SharePoint-Files.htm">Checking In SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>Another option is to open copies of those files in your project (if you decide to use file mappings and synchronization). See <MadCap:xref href="Copying-Mapping-SharePoint-Files.htm">Copying and Mapping SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing-SharePoint-Files.htm">Synchronizing SharePoint Files and Folders</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">For more information about your options for working with SharePoint, see <MadCap:xref href="SharePoint-Integration.htm">About SharePoint Integration</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>All copies of SharePoint files that you added to your project will be located somewhere in the Content folder (in the root itself or under subfolders where you may have placed files when copying them to <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />). Locate the file that you want to open. You can use the "multi-view" to do this.</p>

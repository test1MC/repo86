        <p>This wizard opens when you attempt to accept a reviewed file back into a Flare project, but a conflict exists. The reviewed file you are accepting contains new content with a file name that conflicts with the content file that is already in the project. For example, the reviewer might have inserted a new image that has the same name of an existing image that is already located in the Resources &gt; Images folder in the project. This wizard lets you resolve these conflicts.</p>
        <h2>How to Resolve File Name Conflicts</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If you know you want to use the resource file that already exists in the project instead of the resource file that is contained in the reviewed file, you can click <span class="Emphasis">Finish</span>. Otherwise, click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span> to resolve the conflict.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the next page of the wizard, Flare extracts the file. When the bar is completely green, it is finished. Click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can compare the files in the preview sections on the right. If they are identical and you just want to use the existing resource file in the project instead of the one contained in the incoming reviewed file, select <span class="Emphasis">Use Existing File</span>. But if you want to keep the incoming resource file and the existing resource file separate, select <span class="Emphasis">Reviewer Resource</span>. Then make changes in the <span class="Emphasis">File Name</span> and/or <span class="Emphasis">Import Path</span> fields to give the incoming resource file a different name, store it in a different location, or both. Then click <span class="Emphasis">Next</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the next page of the wizard, you can click <span class="Emphasis">Preview</span> if you want to see once again what the incoming resource file looks like. You can also click <span class="Emphasis">Change</span> to go back to make adjustments to the solution (e.g., enter a different name or location, or choose to use the existing resource file in the project).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you're all done, click <span class="Emphasis">Finish</span>.</p>
            </li>

        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Graphics scale with fonts</span>This field is used to scale the font sizes in the target. It is enabled when the Ignore Font Sizes check box is cleared (false). JavaHelp has a known problem that makes all fonts appear smaller (approximately 1.3 times smaller) than they should be. Setting this field to 1.3 will scale all fonts to adjust their sizes. Enabling the Ignore Font Sizes check box will disable this field, but will also make adjustments so there are consistent default JavaHelp font sizes. </p>

        <p>There are several features in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> that can help you better manage your projects, especially if you have a team of content developers. This includes setting up modular projects, providing various project settings, viewing reports, implementing team authoring, and more.</p>
        <p>Here are the primary ways to manage your project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Migrating Projects </span>Many of us collaborate on Doc-To-Help projects using Team Authoring, TFS, or SharePoint, but sometimes we simply need to transfer a project to a coworker or a client. This is done by sending the entire project folder, but here are a few tips to make the transition easier. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Projects/Migrating-Project.htm">Migrating a Project</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Legacy-HTML5/Projects/Migrating-Project.htm">Migrating a Project</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Modular Projects </span>A modular project is necessary when you have a collection of several different output files (and would like to keep them that way) but would like them to appear to the end user as a single output system. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Projects/Modular/Modular-Projects.htm">About Modular Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Legacy-HTML5/Projects/About-Modular-Projects.htm">About Modular Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>

            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reports </span>Doc-To-Help has several reports that will help you organize your work and keep track of topics and index elements. These reports can be viewed, saved, and printed for maximum flexibility. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Reports/Reports.htm">Reports</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../D2H/Legacy-HTML5/Reports/DocToHelp-Reports.htm">Reports</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>

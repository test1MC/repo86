If users are reinvited to the license, they would have to be re-added to any teams, tasks, or projects that they previously belonged to.</p>
            <p>If users belong to other Central licenses, their profile and avatar are maintained and they will still have access to those licenses. If users do not belong to any other licenses, their profile and avatar are deleted.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to recover the profile and avatar of users once they have been deleted. Instead, you would need to reinvite that person to Central and create the profile again.</p>

        <p>Administrators can associate users with teams and projects in the system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Associating users with teams makes it easier to send messages to those who are designated as authors on the license, as well as to see the activity for a team of users in one place. Also, if you intend to have private output (i.e., output where users must log in), it is necessary to associate those users (authors, SMEs, or viewers) with a team, and then associate that team with the appropriate site.</li>
            <li>Associating users with projects gives those users access to specific projects. Without access to a project, a user—even an administrator—cannot open that project to view it or work in it.</li>
        </ul>

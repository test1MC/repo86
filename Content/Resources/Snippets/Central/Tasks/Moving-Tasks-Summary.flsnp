        <p>You can move tasks between milestones (To Do, In Progress, Completed), or up and down in a milestone to change the order. You can also move tasks to the Backlog and Archive areas. Tasks can be moved by dragging them, or by using menu options. If you want to move a task to a different task board, you can do that too.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Tasks/Main-Activities-Boards/Move-Tasks-Task-Boards.htm">Moving Tasks to Another Board</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

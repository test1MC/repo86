        <p>This lets you add a checklist where the rows are based on files  from your Flare project. Most commonly, these kinds of checklists will be used to track the progress of topics as you edit them, but if you like, you can create checklists that include any other kinds of files from the project (e.g., template pages, images, TOCs, targets, skins).</p>

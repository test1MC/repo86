        <p>A streamlined workflow is available for reviewing MadCap Flare files on Central. This process lets you collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs) and other authors by viewing and working with the same Flare content files (i.e., topics and snippets) in an editor. The Reviews page can be opened on the left side of the interface. From this page, you can view, edit, and manage files that have been sent from Flare for review.</p>

        <p>All users can see all the projects listed in the grid on the Projects page. However, to open a project (by clicking on its name) or take action on it, you must be associated with that project. There are a few ways to become associated with a project. First, you can upload a project to Central yourself. Second, another user can add you to his or her project. Third, if you have “Manage Teams and Projects” permission, you can open your profile and add yourself to a project. And fourth, if another user sends files from a project for you to review, you will automatically become associated with that project.</p>

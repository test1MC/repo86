        <p>You might archive a project if you want to keep a copy of the files in the cloud, but you no longer need the output. An archived project cannot be opened or viewed, and all outputs become inaccessible. If you have a site set to “live,” you cannot archive the associated project unless you first remove the “live” setting.</p>

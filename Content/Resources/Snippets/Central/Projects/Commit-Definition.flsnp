        <p>A commit is a collection of changes in a local Flare project that are pushed up to Central in order to keep the files synchronized. It is up to you to decide which changes are included in a commit, before you continue making further changes that go into the next commit after that. Adding a comment to each commit is a good idea, because it is an easy way to see what types of changes are included in that commit.</p>

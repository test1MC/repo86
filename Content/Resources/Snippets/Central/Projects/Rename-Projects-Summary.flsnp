        <p>There are a couple of ways to rename a Flare project that is bound to Central. You can rename the project in Central only in order to modify how it is displayed in the interface. You can also change the name of the actual project file (FLPRJ) in both Central and Flare. You might even want to perform both sets of steps below so that the project name is the same everywhere.</p>

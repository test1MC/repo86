        <p>The tags and markup that are necessary for Flare topics and snippets are represented by various markers in the editor. These provide a visual cue for the author and reviewer that more than simple text is present. In many cases, the reviewer probably won’t need to—or even be allowed to—make changes to the element. But it is important to know that one of these elements is present so that it does not get deleted accidentally.</p>

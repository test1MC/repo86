        <p class="topic-only">Changing the project name in Central is easy, but doing this will not also change the name of the actual Flare project. It only affects how the project name is displayed in various places in the Central interface; if you open the <a href="../../../../Central/Projects/Page-Views/Viewing-Project-Files.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Files view</a> for the project, you will see that the Flare FLPRJ&#160;file still has the original name.</p>

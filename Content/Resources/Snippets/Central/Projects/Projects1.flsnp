        <p>The Projects page displays a grid, which lists all MadCap Flare projects that have been uploaded to your Central license. These are copies of the local projects located on users’ desktops. There are many good reasons to upload (i.e., bind) Flare projects to Central, including (but not limited to) the following: (1) You can let Central build and host your output, which means you can publish without having to involve an IT department; (2) the connection between your local Flare project files and the cloned files on Central can be used as a source control solution, (3) you can use Central as a platform for topic reviews, and (4) you can manage progress on topic development by using checklists.</p>

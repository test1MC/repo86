        <p>Although you can edit the main file displayed in the editor, you cannot edit certain read-only elements contained in the file, such as snippets and variables. However, because snippets can be sent for review separately, they can be opened and edited directly. Also, in a topic where a snippet is inserted, you can add an annotation near the snippet to provide feedback related to it.</p>

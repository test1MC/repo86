        <p>As you make changes to the imported Flare project, you will need to synchronize those changes with Central periodically to make sure the local and cloud files are in sync. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Main-Activities/Source-Control/Committing-Synchronizing-Single-Bound.htm">Committing and Synchronizing (Pull, Push) in a Single-Bound Model</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Main-Activities/Source-Control/Pushing-Dual-Bound-Model.htm">Pushing in a Dual-Bound Model</MadCap:xref>.</p>

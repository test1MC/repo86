Private URLs can be useful for sharing output with certain co-workers when that documentation is still in a state of development, although you can use private outputs for that purpose as well. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Page-Views/Builds/Other-Activities/Using-Private-URLs.htm">Using Private URLs</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

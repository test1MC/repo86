        <p>If you want to map to your company's own host domain instead of using the default Central domain, you can do so by creating a CNAME (Canonical Name) and following the steps below. You can add as many host mapped domains as you need. The output will still be hosted on Central servers, but the URL that you give to end users will be your company’s domain.</p>

        <p>The URLs page view lets you create and manage all domains (i.e., URLs) for the license. Central provides a default domain that you can use, and you have the option of changing the vanity for it. However, many users just leave it alone, because in most cases the vanity is simply the name of your company. You also have the option of mapping to custom host domains if you want users to see your company's URL instead of Central's.</p>

        <p>Periodically, it is possible that you need to roll back to a previous build that was associated with a live site. For this reason, Flare automatically sets previous live builds to "keep." You can also set builds to "keep" manually<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Central/Projects/Page-Views/Builds/Other-Activities/Setting-Builds-Keep.htm">Setting Builds as Keep</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. The keep setting makes it easier to identify the build to roll back to, and it also prevents a user from accidentally deleting that build.</p>

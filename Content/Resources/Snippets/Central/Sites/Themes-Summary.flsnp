        <p>The Themes page view lets you control how different interface elements look for each site (e.g., 404 pages, login fields). It is possible that you only need one theme for all of your sites, but you can create multiple themes if necessary (e.g., if you have product outputs with different color schemes). If you do not create a theme, the default theme provided by Central will be used.</p>

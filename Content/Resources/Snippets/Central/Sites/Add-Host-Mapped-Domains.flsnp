        <p>If you prefer end users to see your company’s domain instead of Central’s (“mcoutput.com”), you can create a CNAME (Canonical Name) to map to your own host domains. The output will still be hosted on Central servers, but the URL that you give to end users will be your company’s domain.</p>

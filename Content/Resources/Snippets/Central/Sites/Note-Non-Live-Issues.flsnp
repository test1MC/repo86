In cases such as this, the first site created "wins."</p>
            <p>For example, you create a site and point it to an HTML5 build. You do not make the site live or private. Then you create a second site and point to the same build. You do not make this site live, but you do set it as private. When you open the URL&#160;for the second site, you expect it to show login fields, but it doesn't because it is redirected to the URL&#160;of the first site, which is not set as private. If you were to reverse this scenario, you would find yourself opening the URL for a site that isn't set as private, but you are redirected to the URL of the private site.</p>

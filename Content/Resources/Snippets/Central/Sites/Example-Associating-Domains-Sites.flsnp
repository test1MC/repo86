            <p>Perhaps you want all of the knowledge bases to point to kb.fictionsoft.net, and you want the online Help systems to point to help.fictionsoft.net.</p>
            <p>Therefore, you can add those two host mapped domains to the URLs page view. Then, when you create a site, you can point to one of those two domains, depending on whether the output is a knowledge base or a Help system.</p>

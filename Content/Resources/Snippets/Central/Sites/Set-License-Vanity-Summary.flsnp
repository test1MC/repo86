        <p>When you first subscribe to Central, a license vanity is provided for you based on your license (e.g., company) name. This vanity is the prefix (or subdomain) of the default Central domain that is used for your outputs (e.g., <span class="Emphasis">fictionsoft</span>.mcoutput.com). You can change this license vanity if you would like to use something else, although you cannot change the root Central domain (i.e., the last part, which is "mcoutput.com").</p>

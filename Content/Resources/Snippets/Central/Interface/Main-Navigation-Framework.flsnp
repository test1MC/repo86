        <p>The main navigation framework in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> is the top and left navigation area of the workspace. The options remain accessible as you open any of the various pages in the Central license, and some of the options in the top bar dynamically change, depending on the page you open. Also, the Central logo on the lower-left opens the About box, which shows version and copyright information about Central.</p>

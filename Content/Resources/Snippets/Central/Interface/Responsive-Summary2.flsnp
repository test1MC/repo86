        <p>If you are working on a small screen or at a low resolution, you will notice that the main navigation and some elements are moved into a flyout pane, which you can open by clicking <img src="../../../Images/Central/Interface/Buttons/Hamburger-btn.png" alt="" title="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the upper-left corner. This leaves the primary areas of focus in view, but also makes other options easily accessible.</p>

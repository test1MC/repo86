        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">Converts the cursor to Gray Scale Effect mode. This  lets you create a square or rectangle shape by clicking in the image and dragging in any direction. When you release the cursor, the shape is created (in the case of the "zoom" option, a three-dimensional shape is created). The area inside the shape is displayed in its original color, while the area outside the shape is displayed in gray. If you want to create this effect with other closed-off shapes (e.g., oval, polygon), first draw the shape in the image, then enable the gray scale effect from the Image Effects tab in the properties dialog for that object.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture-Online-Only"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../../Capture/Appearance/Effects/Gray-Scale-Effects/Adding-Gray-Scale-Effects.htm">Adding Gray Scale Effects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic">Adds an effect area frame to an image object, allowing you to add a gray scale mask to the object. With this mask, you can apply gray scale to the parts of the image inside or outside of the effect area frame.</p>

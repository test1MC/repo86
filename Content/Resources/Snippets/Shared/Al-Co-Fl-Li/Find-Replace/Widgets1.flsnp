        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> has two widgets that can be used for find and replace—Quick Find and Quick Replace. When opened, these widgets are integrated into the editor when looking for text in a file that is open. These widgets contain the same fields. The only difference between them has to do with which fields are initially shown when the widget is first opened. The Quick Find widget initially displays only the Find fields. The Quick Replace widget shows both the Find and the Replace fields.</p>

        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Condition Tag Sets</span> area, you can choose to view tags for all condition tag sets or you can select a specific set. <span class="topic-only">The tags associated with the selected set are shown to the right, with their associated colors. An Action cell appears next to each condition tag. When Basic is selected, the Action cell is shown and the Advanced section below is disabled. In the Tags area, select a condition tag in the grid to set its action. (You can also hold down the SHIFT or CTRL key and choose multiple rows to set the same action on all of them at once.)</span> </p>

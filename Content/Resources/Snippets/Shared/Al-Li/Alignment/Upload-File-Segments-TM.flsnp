        <p>Once the file/segment alignment process is completed, you can manually upload the translated files or segments to your translation memory database. To do this, you can double-click any of the aligned files in the File Map window pane. Then, in the Alignment Tool, you can select specific segments and click <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Al-Li/Interface/Buttons/Upload-Selected-btn2.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar, or you can click <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Al-Li/Interface/Buttons/Upload-File-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> to upload all of the segments in the file.</p>

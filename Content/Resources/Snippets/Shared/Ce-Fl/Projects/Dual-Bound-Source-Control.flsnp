        <p>If you already have the project on your machine, you do not need to reimport the project from source control. Instead, you can get the latest version from source control by using the Flare Source Control ribbon<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Central,Flare-Guides.Flare-MadCap-Central-Integration-Guide"> (see the Flare online Help)</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>Be sure that you have the latest version of the project because when the project is initially uploaded to Central, a Central ID is added to the project file. You must have the Central ID in your local copy of the project file in order for Central to recognize that your copy of the project is linked to the copy in Central.</p>

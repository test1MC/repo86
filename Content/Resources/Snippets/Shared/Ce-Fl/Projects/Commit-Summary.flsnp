        <p>To commit a changed file is to record it to the local repository. Essentially you are saying, “I’m ready to transfer this content up to the cloned project on Central.” Committing files gives you the opportunity to organize them into different groups when you add them to Central. You can also add a unique comment to each commit.</p>

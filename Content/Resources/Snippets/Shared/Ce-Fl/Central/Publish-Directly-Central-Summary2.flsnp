        <p>As an alternative to building a target on MadCap Central, you can publish output directly to Central from the local Flare project. By “publish,” we mean copying your output files to Central, not making that output “live,” which would make it visible to the general public. You would still need to use Central to make that output accessible to end users.</p>

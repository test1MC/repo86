            <p class="Note-Text">Aside from a few basic tags available in the toolbar (B, I, U, P, H1-H6, and lists), you cannot apply styles to a file that is being reviewed. You can only edit the content. Also, the files will not look exactly like your source files because the formatting from your stylesheet is not rendered in this editor.</p>

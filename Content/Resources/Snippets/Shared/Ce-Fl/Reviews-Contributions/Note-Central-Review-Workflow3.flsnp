            <p class="Note-Text">If you attempt to edit a file that has been sent out for review and is still in an “Open” state, you will see a warning. You can continue to edit the file, but you may have conflicts with the version of the file being reviewed. As an alternative to editing the file in Flare, you can edit it in Central along with your reviewers until it is finished.</p>

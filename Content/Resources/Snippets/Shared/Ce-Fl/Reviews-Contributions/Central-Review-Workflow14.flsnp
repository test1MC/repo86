        <p>After all reviewers submit a file in Central, the author can close out the review process for that file in Flare’s File Reviews window pane. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">This can be done by attempting to open the file, in which case you are prompted to close out the review process. Alternatively, you can select the file (as well as several others) in the File Reviews grid and click <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Ce-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Close-Reviews-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

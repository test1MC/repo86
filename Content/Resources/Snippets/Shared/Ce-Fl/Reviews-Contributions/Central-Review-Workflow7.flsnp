        <p>After completing the wizard, the files are uploaded and reviewers receive an email notification with a link to open the Reviews page in Central. (SMEs automatically receive email notifications; however, Flare authors must have the review notifications and email option enabled in Central to receive emails.) If you are the original author, the files will be listed in your Sent pane. If you are a reviewer, the files will be listed in your Pending pane. Also, you can use a filter above the panes to view files for all projects, or just for a specific project.</p>

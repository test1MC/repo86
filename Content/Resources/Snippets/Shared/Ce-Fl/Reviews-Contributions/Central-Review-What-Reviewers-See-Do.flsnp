        <p>Since the review process is the only feature that is important for SMEs in Central, those users will not see any of the other pages in the interface. They will only see the Reviews page.</p>
        <p>The area on the left shows Flare project files (topics and snippets), contained in three panes—Pending, Submitted, and Archive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Pending </span>This pane displays files that the user needs to review.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Submitted </span>This pane displays files that the user has completed and submitted.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Archive </span>This pane displays files that have been closed (by the author). These files are read-only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To the right is the editor that shows the content for a selected file. And on the far right is the name of the original author above a list of all users who have been assigned to review the selected file. The heading says “Subject Matter Experts,” but the individuals listed can be either SMEs or other authors who are also assigned as reviewers for the selected file. An indicator shows whether each person has submitted the file after completing it.</p>

        <p>If you are viewing Central on a smaller screen or at a low resolution, the author and SME information will be accessible from the flyout menu on the left, which can be opened by clicking <img src="../../../../Images/Central/Interface/Buttons/Hamburger-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the upper-left corner.</p>

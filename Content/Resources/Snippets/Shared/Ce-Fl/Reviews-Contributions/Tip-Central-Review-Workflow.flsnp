However, when sending files for review from Flare, you can remove any snippets from the File grid to exclude them from the review. You might choose to exclude some (or all) snippets from the review if you think it will be too confusing and too many files for your reviewers. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">If you exclude snippets, they will still be visible in the topic in Central, but the snippets will be read-only. Therefore, reviewers won’t be able to make edits in the snippets, but in the topic they can insert annotations (comments) around the snippets in order to provide feedback.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

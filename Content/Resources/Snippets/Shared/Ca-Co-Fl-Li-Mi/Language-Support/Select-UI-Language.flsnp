        <p>You have the option of viewing the interface in English, French, German, Japanese, or Chinese. All of these languages are available from the same version of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> (you do not need to purchase different versions for different languages). When you initially launch <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you are asked to select  your language preference. Based on your selection, the user interface is displayed in the selected language, with the option to switch your preferences at any time from the Select UI Language dialog.  If a particular element is not available in the selected language, that element displays in English.</p>

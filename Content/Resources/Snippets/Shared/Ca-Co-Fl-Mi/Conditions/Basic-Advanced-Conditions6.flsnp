        <p>Another trick you can use while working in the Advanced section is to double-click any tag from the Basic section. This adds the condition to the Advanced section so you do not have to type it. <span class="EmphasisItalic">Just make sure your cursor has been placed in the Advanced section before double-clicking a condition tag. If you don't click in the Advanced section first, the newly added condition tag will overwrite all of the text you've entered previously in the Advanced section.</span></p>

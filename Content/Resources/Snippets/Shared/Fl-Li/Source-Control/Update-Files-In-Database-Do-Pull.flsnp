        <p>If you need to update the files in your local database, you can do a pull. When you pull files, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> retrieves files from the remote repository and downloads them to your local Git database. This updates your current branch with the most current version of the file. This is a good way to get changes that other users have made to a file and pushed to the remote.</p>
        <p>When you pull, you will see the Resolve Version Conflict dialog if conflicts exist between the remove files and the files in your local database.</p>

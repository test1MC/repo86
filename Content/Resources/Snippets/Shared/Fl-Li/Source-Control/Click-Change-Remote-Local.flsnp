        <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Click a change </span>You can click a change on either the remote or local side. This lets you select a particular change. Use the key at the top of the merge changes dialog, as well as the color coding on the local and server sides, to determine if a change has been added (new), deleted, changed, or moved.</p>
        <p>When you select a change, the change you selected will display with a solid colored background, and the conflicting change will display with a striped background. If you select the other change, the background shading will switch.</p>

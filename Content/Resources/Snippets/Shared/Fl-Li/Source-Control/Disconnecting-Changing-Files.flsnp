        <p class="note">If you make a change to a fileâ€™s properties (e.g., delete<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">, rename</MadCap:conditionalText>) while disconnected from source control, your changes may not be preserved when you reconnect to the network. To prevent errors, it is recommended that you do not make these kinds of changes until you reconnect to source control.</p>

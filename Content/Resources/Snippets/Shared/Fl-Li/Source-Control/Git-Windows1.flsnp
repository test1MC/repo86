        <p>In Windows 10 version 1903, Microsoft implemented OpenSSH, which is the open-source version of Secure Shell (SSH). As a result, a project bound to Git using SSH as the transfer protocol might experience error messages (e.g., failed to start SSH session). The solution is to download and install Git for Windows (Git.exe).</p>

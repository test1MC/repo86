        <p>If you have files checked out from source control but do not want them checked out anymore, you can use the "Revert" option instead of submitting the files.&#160;While submitting the file would save your changes to source control, reverting a checkout returns the files to their previously submitted state and does not submit any of your changes to source control.</p>

        <p>Page layouts are similar to template pages, but are more flexible and easier to use. The general rule is that page layouts are recommended for <i>print-based output</i>, and template pages continue to be the best method for automatically adding headers, footers, breadcrumbs, and more in multiple topics for <i>online output</i>. Another difference between page layouts and template pages is that page layouts can be used for either <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.PDF" /> or <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Word" />), whereas template pages can be used only for <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Word" /> when creating print-based output.</p>

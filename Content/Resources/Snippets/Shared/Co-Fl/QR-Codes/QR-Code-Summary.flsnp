        <p>You can insert a quick response (QR) code into a <MadCap:snippetText src="../General/Content-File-Document.flsnp" /> using the XML Editor. A QR code is a type of barcode that can be read by devices such as smart phones. The data encoded in the QR code can be text, a website URL, an email address, contact information, or SMS (Short Message Service, which is used for sending text messages). Basically, QR codes are a way to bridge the gap between a static print document and search-friendly, more detailed online information at your fingertips.</p>

        <p>A toggler is a feature that lets users click a hotspot to reveal one or more named elements in a topic. A named element (also called the "toggler target")&#160;is a chunk of content that can reside anywhere in the topic. When users click the  toggler hotspot, the output reveals hidden content elements. When users click the hotspot again, the content is hidden again.</p>

        <p>Modifies the header content in a table. Why not just use the &lt;td&gt; tag for header content as well? First, by having different tags, you can more easily dictate one look for the header text (e.g., bold font) and a different look for the main content in the table (e.g., normal font). Second, using separate tags greatly assists users with visual disabilities, making it possible for multi-modal wireless browsers with limited display capabilities (e.g., Web-enabled pagers and phones) to handle tables. When you press ENTER after the first paragraph in a table cell, a paragraph &lt;p&gt; tag is added inside each &lt;th&gt; tag in that cell.</p>

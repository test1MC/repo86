        <p>When you perform certain paste actions with tables or content from outside of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, a paste icon  appears in the editor. This icon lets you provide further information about how you want to handle the content (e.g., convert tables to paragraphs, paste content as a list). There is always more than one method that you can choose from when you click on the paste icon. And at the bottom of every list of options is one to set the default behavior for similar actions in the future.</p>

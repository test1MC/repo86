        <p>When you insert a table, it is set up by default to use standard table tags in the individual cells (e.g., &lt;th&gt; for table headers, &lt;td&gt; for regular table text). However, if you press ENTER at the end of a line, a &lt;p&gt; tag is added within the standard tag. Therefore, in order to keep all of the content in your table cells looking consistent, there are a couple of things you can do. First, if you are editing table styles in a regular stylesheet, you can create <a href="../../../../../Flare/Styles/Basics-CSS/Important-Style-Terms-Concepts.htm#AdvancedSelectors" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare-Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">advanced selectors</a> (e.g., "td p"). Second, you may want to create a special style class of the p style to be used for table content (e.g., p.tabletext) and apply that style to all of your cells when you first create a table. You can manually apply specific styles to tables by selecting the table cells, clicking <span class="Emphasis">Table &gt; Cell Content Style</span>, and choosing the style to be used for those cells.</p>

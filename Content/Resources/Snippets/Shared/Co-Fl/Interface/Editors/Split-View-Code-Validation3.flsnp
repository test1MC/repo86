        <p>If the editors are not docked (i.e., you <span class="EmphasisItalic">can</span> see the XML Editor), updates (i.e., highlights, edits) stop going from the code to the XML Editor. If you make an edit in the XML Editor while erroneous XML is in the Text Editor, the changes in the XML Editor take precedence over any edits in the Text Editor.</p>

            <p class="Note-Text"> If you highlight areas in the XML Editor that matches non-consecutive sections of XML, no highlight is shown in the Text Editor. For example, in the XML Editor, you can highlight different parts of a table, but because of the order in which table markup is written in XHTML, it cannot be similarly highlighted in the Text Editor.</p>

        <p>You can view the XML Editor and Text Editor in a docked state, where only one editor can be seen at a time, but you can easily access the other editor by clicking on a tab. Alternatively, you can undock the window and view both the XML&#160;Editor and Text Editor in a split view. Buttons allow you to switch between a horizontal split view and a vertical split view.</p>

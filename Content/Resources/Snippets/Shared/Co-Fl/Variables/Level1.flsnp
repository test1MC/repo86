            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level1 </span>  Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 1. By default, the h1 style has the mc-heading-level set to 1 (that's why it's called a first-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 1 for other styles if you want. </p>

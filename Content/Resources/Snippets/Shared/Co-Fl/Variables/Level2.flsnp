            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level2 </span>Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 2. By default, the h2 style has the mc-heading-level set to 2 (that's why it's called a second-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 2 other styles if you want.</p>

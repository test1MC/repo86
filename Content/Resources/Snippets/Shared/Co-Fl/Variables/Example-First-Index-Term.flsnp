So you create a simple topic called "MyIndex" and insert an Index proxy into it. Then you add that topic to the outline TOC that is being used to produce the manual. </p>
            <p>Next, you open the page layout that you want to use for the topic holding that Index proxy. Let's call it "IndexPL." Suppose you open the page in that layout that will be used for all left-hand pages in the output. In the header frame, you insert the "FirstIndexTerm" variable. Perhaps you want to show the complete range of index terms on each page. So you type the word "through" and also insert the "LastIndexTerm" variable. In addition, you type quotation marks around each variable so that the terms stand out in the output. Therefore, you would have something like this in the frame: </p>
            <p class="Indented">
                <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Variables/First-Last-Index-Term-Variable.png" class="MaxWidth70PercentNoThumbnail" />
            </p>
            <p>Next, in the outline TOC, you create a chapter break on the entry linked to the topic holding the Index proxy. You specify that the entry should use the "IndexPL" layout.</p>
            <p>Now you generate the PDF. You scroll down to the first left-handed page showing the generated index. Let's say the first index term you see on the page is <span class="Emphasis">Moose</span>. The last term on the page is <span class="Emphasis">Sharks</span>. When you look to the very top of the page, you will see this:</p>
            <p class="Indented"><span class="Emphasis">"Moose" through "Sharks"</span>
            </p>

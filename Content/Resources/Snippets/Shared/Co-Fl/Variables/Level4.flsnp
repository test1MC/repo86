            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level4 </span> Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 4. By default, the h4 style has the mc-heading-level set to 4 (that's why it's called a fourth-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 4 for other styles if you want.</p>

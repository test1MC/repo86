            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level6 </span>Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 6. By default, the h6 style has the mc-heading-level set to 6 (that's why it's called a sixth-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 6 for other styles if you want.</p>

            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level3 </span>Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 3. By default, the h3 style has the mc-heading-level set to 3 (that's why it's called a third-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 3 for other styles if you want.</p>

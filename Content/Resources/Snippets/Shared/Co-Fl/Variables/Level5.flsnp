            <span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Level5 </span>  Automatically displays the first text on a page that uses the mc-heading-level style property set at 5. By default, the h5 style has the mc-heading-level set to 5 (that's why it's called a fifth-level heading), but you can change it, and you can set the mc-heading-level to 5 for other styles if you want.</p>

            <li>You can move a block of content by dragging and dropping the appropriate tag bar, or by using options from the context menu.<p class="Subheading">Drag and Drop</p><ol type="1" class="LowerAlpha"><li><p>Click the tag bar that is shown the left of the content you want to move and drag the paragraph or other block tag up or down to the place where you want to move it.

It therefore becomes a child tag within that parent tag. You might use it, for example, to move &lt;p&gt; tags within &lt;div&gt; tags.</p><p><img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Paragraphs/Move-Paragraph-Structure-Bars6.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" /></p><p><img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Paragraphs/Move-Paragraph-Structure-Bars7.png" class="MaxWidth100Percent" /></p></li></ul><div class="note"><p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The options that are shown in the context menu depend on the tag bar that you have selected. In some cases, none of the options may be available. Instead, you might need to use the drag-and-drop method, or perhaps cut and paste the content into the new location.</p></div></li></ol></li>

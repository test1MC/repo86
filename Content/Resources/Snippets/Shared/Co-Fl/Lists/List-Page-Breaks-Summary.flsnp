        <p>You can apply a page or column break to lists or items within them. You might do this if you want a list to end with a particular item on one page and begin with another list item on the next page or column, without interrupting the flow of the list. You can do this by setting manual page breaks (<span class="Emphasis">Insert &gt; Page Break</span>) or by using style settings. For example, you could create a class of the li style and you could call it something like "PageBreakBefore" (li.PageBreakBefore). For most items in a list, you could use the parent li style, but if you want a page break to occur on a particular list item, you could apply your li.PageBreakBefore style to it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">This feature is used for print-based output.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

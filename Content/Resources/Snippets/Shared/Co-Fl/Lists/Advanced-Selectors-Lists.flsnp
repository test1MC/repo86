        <p>An advanced (or "complex") selector lets you format content based on very specific criteria. You can use advanced selectors when creating lists to automatically use different styles for each level in a multi-level list. For example, you could create a multi-level numbered list that uses a regular number in bold for the first-level ol, a lower-alpha number in italics for the second-level ol (i.e., the "ol ol" advanced selector), and a lower-Roman number for the third-level ol (i.e., the "ol ol ol" advanced selector). It could also be a combination numbered and bulleted list. For example, in the "ol ul ol ol" advanced selector, a numbered list is used for the first, third, and fourth levels, and a bulleted list is used for the second level.</p>

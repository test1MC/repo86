        <p>You can create single-level or multi-level numbered or bulleted lists using <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s quick drop-down menu <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Bullet-List-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> on the Home ribbon, as well as by using styles. From the quick drop-down menu, you can select various list formats (e.g., circle bullet, alpha number, Roman number). However, it is a best practice to limit your selections to the <span class="Emphasis">Bullet List</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Numbered List</span> options, then rely on <a href="../../../../../Flare/Lists/Main-Activities/Editng-List-Styles/Specifying-List-Type-Style.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">list style settings</a> to provide the type of list item automatically depending on its level. For example, for a three-level numbered list, you can place settings on the <span class="Emphasis">ol</span> style for the first level, on <span class="Emphasis">ol ol</span> for the second level, and on <span class="Emphasis">ol ol ol</span> for the third level.</p>

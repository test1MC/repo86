        <p>After you have created a bulleted or numbered list, you can reorder the items in the list in ascending or descending order. Also, you have the option of sorting the list immediately, or you can have Flare sort it automatically later when you build output. For example, sorting at build time might be a useful option if you always want a particular list sorted, but multiple authors are working on the list over a period of time, and you want to ensure that the last author making edits does not forget to sort the list. Translation is another reason to sort lists at build time. Because languages use different characters, this ensures that the list in each output is sorted appropriately.</p>

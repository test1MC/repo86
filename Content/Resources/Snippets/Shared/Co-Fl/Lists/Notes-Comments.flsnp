        <p>When creating a list, you may want to include information (e.g., additional text, notes, images) between items without interrupting the flow of the list. You can do this with paragraph items (i.e., &lt;p&gt; tags within list tags). These are automatically added to new bulleted and numbered lists. However, you can remove them if you want. You can also change your default settings so that new lists do not initially include paragraph items. Definition lists do not initially have paragraph items by default, but you can change that if you want.</p>

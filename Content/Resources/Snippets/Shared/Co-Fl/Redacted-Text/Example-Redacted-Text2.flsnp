In that case, you might open your stylesheet and create a class of the span character style, calling it "Redacted." You also might create a class of the p style, naming it "Redacted." After specifying the redaction value for each of those style classes, you can then apply those classes to your content as needed. If you highlight a few words within a paragraph, you can select <span class="Emphasis">span.Redacted</span> to black out those words. If you want to redact an entire paragraph, you can click the tag bar to the left of that paragraph and select the <span class="Emphasis">p.Redacted</span> style class.</p>

        <p>Locate and select the border property you want to change. Each side (bottom, left, right, top) has separate properties that you can set for the color, style, and width (e.g., border-bottom-style). You can set these properties individually, or you can set the primary property for each side (e.g., border-bottom), which lets you specify the color, style, and width in one place. If you plan to have the same settings for all sides, you can use the main <span class="Emphasis">border</span> property to set the color, style, and width the same. The border-radius properties let you create curved edges on the border by providing horizontal and vertical values.</p>

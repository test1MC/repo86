            <p class="Note-Text">You can use the toggle button <img src="../../../../Images/Flare/Interface/Buttons/Toggle-Double-Click-TOC-Entry-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> on the right side of the local toolbar in a TOC or browse sequence if you want to reverse the normal double-click behavior. The default behavior (without the toggle button selected) is that double-clicking an item will open the properties dialog, and holding down the CTRL key while double-clicking will open the file linked to the item. If you activate the toggle button, this behavior is reversed; double-clicking an item opens the file linked to it, and holding the CTRL key while double-clicking will open the properties dialog.</p>

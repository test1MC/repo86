        <p>After you insert an image, you can create multiple hyperlinks for specific sections of the image. This is called an "image map." Image maps engage online users to click linked parts of an image that reveal more information.</p>
        <p>The image map contains a “hotspot,” which is the part of the image that contains the link as you hover the mouse on it (e.g., text, icon). It also contains a target frame property that determines how the link opens (e.g., popup, tab, window).</p>
        <p>The foundation of an image map can take on several forms, such as a graphic, photo, or map. The image map is anything with identifiable clickable areas.</p>

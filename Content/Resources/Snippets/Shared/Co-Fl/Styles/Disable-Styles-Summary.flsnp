        <p>You cannot remove root styles provided by <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. However, you can prevent certain styles from being shown in the Stylesheet Editor and in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface. Rather than being overwhelmed with the sight of all styles in the stylesheet, you can ensure that you see only the styles that you tend to use. Those styles will not be removed from the stylesheet; they will simply be hidden until you enable them.</p>

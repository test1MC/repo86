        <p>After creating a regular stylesheet, you need to associate (link) the stylesheet with files (e.g., topics, template pages, snippets, micro content) where you want to use those styles. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">You can associate a primary stylesheet at the project or target level, which means that the stylesheet will automatically be applied to all topics and micro content in that project or target (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Styles/Main-Activities/Associating-Primary-Stylesheets-All-Files.htm">Associating Primary Stylesheets With All Files</MadCap:xref>). Alternatively, you can associate stylesheets with specific content files. This is the method to use when you have multiple stylesheets for a particular output. You can even associate multiple stylesheets with a single file.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

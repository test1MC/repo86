        <p>By their very nature, many style properties are considered “inherited,” while a significant number of others are “non-inherited.” This refers to how the properties act when tags are nested in a content file, such as a topic or snippet. Inherited properties for one style will trickle down to the content found in another tag within it. On the other hand, non-inherited properties will not be used by the content in the nested tags.</p>

        <p>If you have more than one stylesheet<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> in your project</MadCap:conditionalText>, you can link them together. By doing this, one stylesheet can adopt the styles of the other stylesheet so that they can be used in content files where that stylesheet is applied.</p>

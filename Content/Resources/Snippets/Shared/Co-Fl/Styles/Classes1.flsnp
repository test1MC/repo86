        <p MadCap:conditions="">In CSS there are primary styles that correspond to the different HTML elements (e.g., h1, h2, p, img). You can think of these as parent styles, because in a way, they can have children. A class is the most common type of child for a style. Some classes might already be included in your stylesheet<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> when you first create a project</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>

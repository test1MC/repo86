        <p>By default, the Style Inspector shows styles and properties from your local stylesheet(s). However, there might also be many other styles and properties at work in the file that you have open; these other styles and properties are inherited from system (or “factory”) stylesheets that are located where you installed <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>

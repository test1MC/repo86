This includes factory mediums and media queries, as well as those that you may have created. If you have "Hide Inherited" enabled, the factory mediums and media queries will not show up in the drop-down if you have not yet made any edits to them. In the Advanced view of the editor, you can have multiple mediums or media queries open at the same time.The default medium is always placed on the left of the others. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare-Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Styles/Other-Features-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries/Main-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries.htm">About Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Contributor"> See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Contributor/Styles/Mediums/Mediums-Media-Queries.htm">About Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

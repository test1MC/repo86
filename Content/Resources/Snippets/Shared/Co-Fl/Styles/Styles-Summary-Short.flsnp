        <p>Styles are used to control the look and feel of your documentation, and keep the content separate from its presentation. The styling is based on cascading stylesheets (CSS), which is an international standard for formatting web content, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (or <a href="http://w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>).</p>

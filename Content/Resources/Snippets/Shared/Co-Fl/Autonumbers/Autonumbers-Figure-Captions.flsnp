        <p>Perhaps you have inserted multiple images<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> into your project</MadCap:conditionalText>, with a caption under each image. If you want the captions for each chapter to be numbered (e.g., "Image1-1," "Image 1-2," "Image 1-3," "Image 2-1," "Image 2-2"), you can apply autonumber formats to that content. If you insert a new figure caption with that format between existing captions, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will renumber them automatically.</p>

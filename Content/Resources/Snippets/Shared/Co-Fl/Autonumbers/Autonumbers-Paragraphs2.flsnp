        <p>The following steps show you how to create an autonumber format for a single paragraph. You also have the option of creating an autonumber format for a style. It is recommended that you use the style method whenever possible. A style lets you apply the same format to multiple paragraphs<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> throughout your project</MadCap:conditionalText>, and any changes to the format are applied automatically to all the paragraphs using that style. </p>

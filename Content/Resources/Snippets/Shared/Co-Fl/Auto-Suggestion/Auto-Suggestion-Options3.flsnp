        <p>Rather than automatically basing auto suggestions on all of the text<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> throughout your entire project</MadCap:conditionalText>, you have control over the phrases that you see in the popup when you type. You can add your own words and phrases to an auto suggestions list. That way, instead of being overwhelmed with too many suggestions every time you begin typing text, you only see suggestions that you are likely to use.</p>

        <p>If the review package contains topics as well as snippet files, you can open the snippets too. You can open snippets by double-clicking them in the Review Packages window pane. Another approach is to right-click the snippet where it is inserted in a topic (or in another snippet) and from the context menu select <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span>.</p>

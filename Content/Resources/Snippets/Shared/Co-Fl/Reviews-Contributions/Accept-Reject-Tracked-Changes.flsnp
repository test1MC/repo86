        <p>When you track changes, every change to the document—along with the user who performed the change—will be stored in the document’s markup. When a change is accepted or rejected, all markup designating it as a change is removed. When all changes in the document are resolved, they will not contain any history of changes made and can be considered ready for output.</p>

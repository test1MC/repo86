        <p>If you want to use the integrated email feature, you must have matching versions of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> and Outlook. If you are using 64-bit <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you need 64-bit Outlook. Likewise, if you are using 32-bit <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you need 32-bit Outlook.</p>

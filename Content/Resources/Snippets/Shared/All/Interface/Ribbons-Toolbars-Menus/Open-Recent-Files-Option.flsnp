        <p value="1" class="TableText">Displays a list of recently opened files. You can select one from the list to open it. You can also remove files from the list of recently opened files, which lets you keep the list shorter and more manageable. When you use this feature, the file is merely removed from the list, but the actual file is not deleted.</p>

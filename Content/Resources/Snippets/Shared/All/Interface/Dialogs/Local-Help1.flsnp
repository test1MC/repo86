        <p>Because the Help system is hosted online, you may not be able to access it if you are behind a firewall or if you have a slow connection. In that case, you can use a local version of the Help. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will even switch to the local Help automatically if it detects that you cannot connect to the external Help system.</p>

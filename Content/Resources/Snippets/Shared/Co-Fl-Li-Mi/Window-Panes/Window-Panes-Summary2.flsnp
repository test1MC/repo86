        <p>If more than one window pane is open in the same location in the interface, the panes are organized in an accordion or tab structure. This means they are stacked on top of each other, with the active window pane displayed in front of the others. You can click any accordion bar or tab to bring that particular window pane in front so you can work in it.</p>

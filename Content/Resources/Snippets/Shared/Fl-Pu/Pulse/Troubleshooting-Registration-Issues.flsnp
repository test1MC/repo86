        <p>If you are attempting to register for a Pulse account and encounter a message that says "A user name for that email address already exists,"&#160;it may be possible that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have already created a Pulse account and need a new password. </li>
            <li>You have already created a Pulse account and need to complete the registration process. </li>
            <li>Someone accidentally entered your email address when creating a Pulse account. However, since they entered your email address, the confirmation email was delivered to your email address and the person was never able to confirm that registration. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In any of these events, it is easy to reclaim your Pulse account.</p>

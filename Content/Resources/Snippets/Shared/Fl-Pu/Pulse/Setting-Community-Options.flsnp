        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">You can set community options, which control the display of comments and search results. For both Standard and HTML5 skins, you can do this in the Skin Editor. For HTML5 outputs—including skinless—you can also use your stylesheet to display or hide topic comments; this makes it possible to show comments for some topics but hide them for others.</p>

        <p>If you are developing an online Flare target for a single product, service, or purpose, integrating Flare is a straightforward process. You simply install Pulse and then add a new Flare community to create a corresponding system in Pulse. However, because many organizations develop multiple Flare targets, you also have these options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Add a Single Flare Community for Use With Multiple Targets </span>In this scenario, you add one Flare community which creates a corresponding Pulse system. Then you associate that community with multiple Flare targets. This method gives you less-granular reporting capabilities in Pulse.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Add a Unique Flare Community for Each&#160;Different Target </span>In this scenario, you add a unique Flare community for each different target. This creates a separate system in Pulse.&#160;The advantage of using this option is that it gives you more granular reporting capabilities, letting you generate usage reports for each community.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

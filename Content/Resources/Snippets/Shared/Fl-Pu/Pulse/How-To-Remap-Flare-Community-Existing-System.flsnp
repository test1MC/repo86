        <p>As you prepare to publish content updates to a Flare target, you can review the new, removed, and updated topics and then reassign any of the topics to the appropriate stream&#160;in the Pulse system. This stream corresponds to the embedded discussion form at the bottom of the Flare topic. </p>

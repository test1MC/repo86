        <p class="TableText">When you add a Flare community to a target, that community is automatically added as a system in Pulse. This gives members of the Customers group the ability to post updates, questions, articles, and tasks in embedded discussion forms for your Flare output. Members of the Administrators and Employees groups can also moderate these posts and other Pulse features using the Pulse dashboard. </p>

        <p>Deleting a Pulse user removes all access to Pulse and keeps the user information in the Pulse database. To give a user the ability to re-use the email address in Pulse, you must first delete the user from the dbo.Users and dbo.Login tables in SQL&#160;Server. Once the entries are deleted, the email can be used to create a new Pulse account.</p>

        <p>You can create groups to communicate with a specific subset of users. This is helpful when you want to use Pulse as a vehicle for sharing Pulse content with a specific audience. For example, you might have a Flare community with a Pulse system for a project about pets&#160;and have a need to create separate groups for users with a specific interest in  dogs&#160;or cats. This gives you the ability to post updates and articles, as well as ask questions specifically targeted for those members. </p>

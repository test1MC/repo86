        <p>If you need to publish any updates for your Flare output and do not wish to create a new community for your documentation release, select the community that you previously created for the target. This gives you the ability to ensure that any new, removed, and updated topics are mapped to the appropriate embedded discussion forms in the Pulse system. </p>

You receive an email notification stating that a user has posted a comment in one of your topics. So you click the topic name link in the email notification to see the feed where the comment was posted. The feed opens in the dashboard view of Pulse, which shows only the feed and not the topic associated with it.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, let's say you provide a published URL to your community. In that case, when you click the topic link, the topic opens in the actual Flare output. You see both the topic and the Pulse feed below it, therefore giving context to the post.</p>

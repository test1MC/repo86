        <p>Let's say you create a Flare project and structure it in much the same way that some of Flare's project templates are structured. In other words, you have a main Home page that looks much different than the rest of your topics and serves primarily as a landing page with links, not to provide content. Therefore, you do not want the Pulse comment area to be displayed at the bottom of that topic.</p>

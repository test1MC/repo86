        <p>You can enhance the Flare search engine by creating a synonym file for interchangeable words. This gives the Flare search engine to ability to return results that include a similar word, when a user enters a particular word. For example, when a user searches for "hound,"&#160;the synonym file tells the Flare search engine to also return results that include the synonym "dog." </p>
        <p>When integrated with Pulse, the Flare search engine will search both the Flare topic files and the embedded Pulse discussion forms. </p>

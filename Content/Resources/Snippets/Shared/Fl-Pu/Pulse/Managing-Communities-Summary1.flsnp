        <p>A community is a collection of registered users that have access to a set of social features. When a Flare community is integrated with a Pulse system, users have access to the same type of community functions that one would find on a social media site.</p>
        <p>You can manage communities using either the Pulse dashboard or the Flare interface (i.e., the Target Editor).</p>
        <p>In the Pulse dashboard, the Administration &gt; Settings menu command is available to members of the Administrators group. This gives you the ability to click <span class="Emphasis">Communities</span> to view a list of the Flarecommunities that have been integrated with Pulse.</p>

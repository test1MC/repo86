        <p>In the Pulse dashboard, the Administration &gt; Settings menu command is available to members of the Administrators group. This gives administrators the ability to click the <span class="Emphasis">Suggested Feeds</span> feature. This lets administrators use Pulse as a content distribution network by adding feeds to Pulse. Administrators can set up suggested feeds to make them available to users who belong to the Administrators or Employees group. </p>

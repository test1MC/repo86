        <p>Pulse users can self-declare any of the skills you input. A great place to start your skills list is LinkedIn and other industry-specific websites. Each skill can be assigned to a skill category. Therefore, you may want to create a skill category first. Skill categories are used in Pulse to make locating and grouping skills easy. Some good skill categories are things like Human Resources, Legal, or Information Technology. Think about people’s job roles and departments for ideas on skill categories.</p>

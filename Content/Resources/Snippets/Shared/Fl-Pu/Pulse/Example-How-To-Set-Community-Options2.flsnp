        <p>As far as the other topics are concerned, they are using a different stylesheet. But you don't need to set the mc-community-features property in it, because the default setting is to enable the Pulse comments area. Therefore, the comment area will automatically be displayed. The only thing you need to do is make sure all of those topics are using the appropriate stylesheet. </p>

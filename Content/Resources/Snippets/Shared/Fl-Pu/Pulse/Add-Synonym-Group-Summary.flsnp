        <p>Add a synonym group to perform queries for identical synonyms. An identical synonym is a word that can be queried in two directions. For example, a query for the "dog" would find results that include identical synonyms such as "hound" and "canine." A search for "canine"&#160;or "hound"&#160;would include the identical synonym "dog." </p>

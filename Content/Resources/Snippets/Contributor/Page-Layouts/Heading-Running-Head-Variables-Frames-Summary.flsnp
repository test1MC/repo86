        <p>If you want certain content to be inserted into a frame automatically (rather than typing the text manually), you can use a variable. For example, you might want to automatically include the first h1 heading of each chapter into the header for certain pages. By using a Heading variable, you can use just one page layout for all of your chapters, rather than having to create a new page layout for each chapter. For <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.PDF" />  output, you can also use Heading variables to automatically display glossary headings, index headings, or index terms in a page layout frame.</p>

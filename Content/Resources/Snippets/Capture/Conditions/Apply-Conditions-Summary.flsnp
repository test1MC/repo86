        <p>You can apply condition tags to  objects that have been added to images. You do not need to apply conditions to each and every object in an image, but rather only to those objects that should be included in some outputs but excluded from other outputs. If a particular object should always be included in the image, there is no need to apply a condition tag to it. </p>

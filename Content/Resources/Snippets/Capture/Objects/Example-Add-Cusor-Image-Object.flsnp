            <p>You want to create an image showing a software application window with a hand cursor <img src="../../../Images/Capture/Objects/Hand-Cursor.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> floating over a particular area of the screen shot. The problem is that you are unable to capture the cursor, but rather the window only. A solution is to obtain a cursor file (perhaps by searching for one on your computer) and add it to the image that you have captured.</p>

        <p>You can create a gray scale effect in conjunction with a shape that you add to an image. This is a useful effect, for example, if you want to highlight a particular area of an image, without hiding the rest of the image. You can draw a shape around the area of the image that you want to emphasize and then apply the gray scale effect. The area inside the shape remains displayed in the original color, but the rest of the image around the shape is displayed in gray. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a gray scale effect.</p>

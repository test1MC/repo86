        <p>You can create a blur-inside effect in conjunction with a shape that you add to an image. This is a useful effect, for example, if you want to hide a particular area of an image, perhaps information that is confidential. You can draw a shape around the area of the image that you want to hide and then apply the blur-inside effect, determining how much "blurriness" is used. The area inside the shape is blurred, but the rest of the image around the shape remains clear. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a blur-inside effect.</p>

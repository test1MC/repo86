        <p>You can add a zoom effect to an object in an image. This creates a 3D effect that magnifies (and therefore emphasizes) a specific area in an image so that it appears closer than the rest of the image. When you create a zoom effect, you have control over the appearance of the effect, including the position of the enlarged area and the percentage at which the area is magnified.</p>

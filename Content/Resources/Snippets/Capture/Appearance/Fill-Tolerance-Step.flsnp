        <p>In the local toolbar, use the <span class="Emphasis">Fill Tolerance</span> drop-down <img src="../../../Images/Capture/Interface/Buttons/Color-Fill-Tolerance-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> to adjust the tool's sensitivity to slight variations in color. <span class="topic-only">Use a low tolerance if you want to select very specific areas of the image. Use a high tolerance if you want to select an area where there are very slight differences in a color, or if you want to intentionally select large sections of an image.</span></p>

            <p class="Note-Text">If you select multiple languages, you can switch between them in the Project Properties dialog and other areas in Lingo. This makes it easy for you to create projects that need to be translated into multiple languages. You can add new languages to or remove languages from a project after all exported bundles have been merged.

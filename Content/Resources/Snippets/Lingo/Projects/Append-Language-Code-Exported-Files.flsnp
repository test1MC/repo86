        <p>(Optional) If you are translating non-project files and want to apply a code (e.g., "es" for Spanish) to the individual files you are exporting, select <span class="Emphasis">Append language code to files</span>. <span class="topic-only">This setting is beneficial if you want to flatten the exported files so you can see them side by side, instead of having all instances of the same file name without any language code attached to those files.</span></p>

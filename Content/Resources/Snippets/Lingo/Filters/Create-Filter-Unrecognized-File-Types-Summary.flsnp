        <p> If you add a file type that Lingo does not recognize, you will see a warning image next to the file filter drop-down. To resolve this, you can add a text file type filter to the file. This will treat the file type as a text file and allow you to translate the file.</p>
        <p>If you do not add a file type filter to the file, it will be discarded when you create the Lingo project.</p>

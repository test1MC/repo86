        <p>When you create a Lingo project, you can create a project from a folder. You can filter the file types in the folder so only some files are included in the translation project. You can also create additional filters for any files that may be in the folder so only certain parts of the file are imported for translation. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Lingo/Projects/Creating-Projects.htm">Creating New Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

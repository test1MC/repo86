        <p>(Optional) If you want to save previously used MT results in an XLIFF&#160;file, select <span class="Emphasis">Cache MT results as XLIFF&#160;alternates</span>. This prevents the MT&#160;from looking for new translations for previously translated segments. If the source segment is modified, the MT will look for a new translation for the updated segment. If this option is disabled, the MT&#160;will look for new translations whenever you click a target segment or translate the project with the MT.</p>

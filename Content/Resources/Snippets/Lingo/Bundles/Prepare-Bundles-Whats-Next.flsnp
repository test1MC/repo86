        <p>After receiving these files from you, the translator unzips the file, opens it in Lingo or imports the content files into a third-party tool, and translates all of the segments. When finished, the translator puts the completed files into a ZIP or LIPRJZIP file, and sends it to you. At this point, you can merge those files into your original <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Lingo/Bundles/Merging-Completed-Bundles.htm">Merging Completed Bundles</MadCap:xref>.</p>

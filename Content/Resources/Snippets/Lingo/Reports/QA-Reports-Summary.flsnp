        <p>You can run quality assurance (QA) reports to review your translated projects for discrepancies between the source and target segments. This is a way to check the quality of your translations before sending your project for review, returning a translation to a client, or exporting the final, translated project. <MadCap:snippetText src="QA-Useful.flsnp" /></p>

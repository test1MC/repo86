        <p>You might have used template pages in earlier versions of Flare when creating Word output, but then decide to use the newer page layouts instead. You can manually remove all links to template pages in your target and table of contents. However, another alternative is to automatically disable the use of template pages in your project. By using this feature, Flare will ignore all links to template pages when you generate the Word target. It will instead use links that you provide to any page layouts.</p>

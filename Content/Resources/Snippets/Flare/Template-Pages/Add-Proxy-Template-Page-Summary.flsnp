        <p>Depending on the template page template that you select, you might already have one or more types of proxies in your template page. Some of these proxies are used primarily for online output (e.g., Breadcrumbs, Menu, Search Bar), some are used for printed output (e.g., Glossary, Index, TOC, Page Header, Page Footer), and some may be used for both online and printed output (e.g., Body, Mini-TOC). Some proxies are typically added to topics, whereas others are usually inserted into template pages, and some (e.g., Mini-TOC proxies) are often used in either.</p>

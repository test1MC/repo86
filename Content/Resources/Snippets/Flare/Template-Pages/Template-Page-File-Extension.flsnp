        <p>Like all other files in Flare, a template page is an XML file. It has an <MadCap:keyword term="FLMSP file" />.flmsp extension. The traditional location to store it in the Content Explorer is in the Resources &gt; TemplatePages folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like.</p>

    <body>The recommended location to store a template page in the Content Explorer is in the Resources &gt; TemplatePages folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like. At any time, you can open a template page and make modifications to it. The template page displays in its own page of the XML Editor and remains accessible as you work. </body>

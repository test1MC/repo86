        <p>It is recommended that you always store your project locally, rather than on a network. Of course, there may be times when you need to place a copy of your project on a network (e.g., to use source control, or to make a copy available to a co-worker). But performance and speed should be significantly better if you work on a local copy of the project rather than working on it from a remote server. Working on a remote copy of a Flare project is also not an ideal solution for team authoring, because there is not a good solution for resolving file conflicts between writers.</p>

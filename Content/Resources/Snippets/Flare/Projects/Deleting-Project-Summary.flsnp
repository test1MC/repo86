        <p>To delete a project completely, you must use Windows Explorer. This operation cannot be done from <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. </p>
        <p>You can also remove projects from displaying as recent projects in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. This does not delete the project, but simply removes it from those shortcut locations.</p>

        <p>A font set  is a collection of font families. You can create a font set in order to designate the substitute fonts to use when the preferred font is not available on the user's computer. If the first (i.e., preferred) font family in the set is not found on the user's computer, the second font family in the set is used. If the second font family is not found, the third font family is used, and so on.</p>

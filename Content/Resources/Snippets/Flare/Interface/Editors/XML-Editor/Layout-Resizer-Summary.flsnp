        <p>The layout resizer allows you to easily view how your output and text might look for different screen sizes, and experiment with custom sizes. As you click the controls on the resizing slider or enter a breakpoint to alter the width setting, the content in the editor will dynamically respond.</p>
        <p>If you have different styles to display for various mediums or screens (i.e., for a tablet device, or a smart phone), the layout resizer is a convenient way to see those style settings without having to generate output. In the XML Editor, you can also use the layout resizer to create a new media query in the stylesheet based on the position of the layout resizer.</p>

            <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s user interface lets you switch between using a ribbon layout, or using a more traditional tool strip layout. The ribbon layout consists of a File drop-down with common tasks such as creating new projects and files, as well as opening and saving documents. This is followed by the Home ribbon, which is the default, and several others related to various features in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>

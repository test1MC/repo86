        <p>Opens the Accessibility Suggestions window pane, where you can search for places in your project where you can make accessibility improvements for web-based and PDF outputs in Flare. That way, you can make sure your documentation can be accessed by people with disabilities (i.e., individuals who have visual, hearing, and mobility impairments). This includes the ability to identify tables that are missing certain elements and finding objects—such as images, equations, and QR codes—that are missing alternate text. You can click the "Search Properties" button to customize which types of issues to display in the window pane. You can double-click a row to open the topic or other file. You can also right-click on the row and select <span class="Emphasis">Open</span>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Analysis/Suggestions/Accessibility/Viewing-Accessibility-Suggestions2.htm">Viewing Accessibility Suggestions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

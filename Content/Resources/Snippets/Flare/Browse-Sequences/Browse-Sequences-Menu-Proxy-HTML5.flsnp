            <p class="Note-Text">In most cases, browse sequences are generated via a skin. This method is supported in HTML5 Tripane output, but not in HTML5 Side Navigation, Top Navigation, or skinless output. However, another way to use a browse sequence is by associating it with a menu proxy (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Proxies/Menus/Creating-Topic-Menu.htm">Creating a Topic Menu</MadCap:xref>). With this method, browse sequences are supported in all HTML5 output formats.</p>

        <p>Let's say two authors—Bob and Jill—are working on the same project, using source control to manage the files.</p>
        <p>Bob checks out the "FAQs" topic and starts making changes to it.</p>
        <p>Jill also checks out the "FAQs" topic and makes some changes to it. Jill's changes are in the same paragraph in the topic as Bob's changes; thus, there is a conflict. She finishes before Bob and commits the file to source control.</p>
        <p>Bob finishes his changes and tries to submit the file. Before the file can be submitted, Bob is prompted with a dialog, indicating that changes from another author have already been submitted.</p>

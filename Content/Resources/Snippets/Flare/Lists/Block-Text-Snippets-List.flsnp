            <li><span class="Emphasis">Block Snippets </span>A block snippet in a list item retains the styling used on the content in that snippet (e.g., if the paragraph color in the snippet is blue, it will continue to be blue).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Text Snippets </span>A text snippet in a list item uses the styling for the list (e.g., if the paragraph color in the snippet is blue but in the list it is red, the content in the inserted snippet will be red). To use a text snippet, you can first type a single character in the empty list item, drag the snippet next to it, then remove the character.</li>

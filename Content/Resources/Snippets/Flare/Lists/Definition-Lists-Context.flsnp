        <p>By using definition list tags—as opposed to different markup, such as headings and regular paragraphs—you are providing context for the content. In other words, not only do end users recognize they are looking at a list of definitions and terms, but this kind of semantic markup allows meta data to be associated with it. Therefore, that information can more easily be extracted automatically.</p>

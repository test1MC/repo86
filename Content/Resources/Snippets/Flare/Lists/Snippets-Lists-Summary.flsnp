        <p>Keep in mind that snippets inserted as list items are treated differently, depending on whether they are inserted as block snippets versus text snippets. A block snippet consumes all of the space where it was inserted, whereas a text snippet does not (i.e., you can add more text in front of it or after it). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Snippets/General-Information/Text-Block-Snippets.htm">Text and Block Snippets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>JScript  is Microsoft's extended implementation of ECMAScript (ECMA262), an international standard based on Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript languages. JScript is implemented as a Windows Script engine. This means that it can be "plugged in" to any application that supports Windows Script, such as Internet Explorer, Active Server Pages, and Windows Script Host. It also means that any application supporting Windows Script can use multiple languages—JScript, VBScript, Perl, and others. JScript (and the other languages) can be used for both simple tasks (such as mouseovers on web pages) and for more complex tasks (such as updating a database with ASP or running logon scripts for Windows NT). Windows Script relies on external "object models" to carry out much of its work. For example, Internet Explorer's DOM provides objects such as "document" and methods such as "write()" to enable the scripting of web pages.  </p>

        <p>VBScript &#160;is a scripting language based on MS Visual Basic and, like JavaScript, is embedded in a web page. The interpretation and execution of scripts is controlled by the web client. Much like JavaScript, functions are most often executed by mouse functions, navigation buttons, Active X controls or by actions initiated by the user or by automated scripting such as retrieving user computer information.</p>

        <p>First, markers can be turned on or off, providing a visual cue about the content in the form of brackets. When you insert a variable into a topic with markers turned on, the variable definition is displayed in a marker represented by brackets on either side of the definition. If you cannot see all of the information in a marker, you can adjust the marker width. (Click the down arrow next to the <span class="Emphasis">Show tags</span> button <img src="../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Show-Tags-btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the XML Editor. The marker width field is at the bottom of the drop-down menu.)</p>

        <p>A styled variable lets you change the way a variable looks—making it easier for you to identify your variables in the output as well as in the XML Editor. This is mainly achieved by editing the stylesheet property settings for the MadCap|variable element. When a styled variable is applied, it can be seen in the XML Editor and in any generated output type.</p>

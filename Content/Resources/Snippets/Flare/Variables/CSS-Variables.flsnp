        <p>You also might hear about CSS variables. These are not the same as the regular variables that are stored in the Project Organizer. Instead, CSS variables are created in a stylesheet. But like regular variables, CSS variables can be used to create information in one place and then re-use it in many places. In the case of CSS variables, you specify a style value once and then insert that variable in any style properties where you want to use it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Styles/Other-Features-Activities/Regular-Stylesheets/CSS-Variables/CSS-Variables.htm">CSS Variables</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

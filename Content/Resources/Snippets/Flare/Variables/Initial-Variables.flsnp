        <p>There are usually some initial custom variables (e.g., CompanyName and PhoneNumber) already provided when you start a new project or add a new variable set (using the "MyVariables" template). You can use these variables, modifying their names and/or definitions to meet your needs. You can also create additional variables. A variable set file has <MadCap:keyword term="FLVAR file" />an .flvar extension and is stored in the Project Organizer under the Variables folder.</p>

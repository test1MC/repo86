However, you can code HTML and use a CGI script to create server-side image maps, where the file containing the links is located on a server. One down side of server-side image maps is that alt tags cannot be read, and therefore the output is not as accessible as it would be with client-side image maps. There is an option on the Warnings tab of the Target Editor for the web formats—<MadCap:snippetText src="../Output/All-Web-Outputs-HTML5-Clean-XHTML.flsnp" />. This option lets you see compiler warnings when a server-side image map is found in the output.</p>

You want users to be able to quickly browse through them using the TAB key, so that they can select an image and then press ENTER to temporarily enlarge the thumbnail to full size. Without tab indexes set, the images will be selected in a horizontal order as the user presses the TAB key (i.e., the image in the first cell is selected first, followed by the image in the cell to the right, followed by the image in the first cell of the second row, and finally the second image in the second row).</p>

            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Images-Guide" />
            <p>However, you want the images do be selected downward (i.e., selecting those in the first column before those in the second column). Therefore, you edit each image and enter the appropriate tab index value on it.</p>

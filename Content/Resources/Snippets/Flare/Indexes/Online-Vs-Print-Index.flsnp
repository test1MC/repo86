        <p>An index in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> works much like an index in a printed book. It provides key terms that point the user or reader to specific locations where the information is stored. The main difference is that, in a printed book, a reader must manually turn pages to get to the desired page listed in the index. In online output, an end user simply clicks an item in the index and the item opens immediately.</p>
        <p>When you create print output, you can convert your online index to printed format.</p>

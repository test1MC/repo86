        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s method of producing an index includes the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Indexes:keywords" />Prevents Index Keywords from Pointing to Deleted Content </span>Let's say you have inserted an index keyword within a particular paragraph in a topic. Later, you decide to delete the paragraph. Doing this also deletes the index keyword, so when the index is generated, that index keyword is no longer included in it. You do not have to remember to delete the index keyword from another location or file.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Copies Index Keywords for You </span>Let's say you have inserted an index keyword within a particular paragraph in a topic. You then copy that paragraph and paste it into another topic. When you do this, the index keyword is also copied, which means that you do not have to worry about creating it again for that topic.</li>
        </ul>

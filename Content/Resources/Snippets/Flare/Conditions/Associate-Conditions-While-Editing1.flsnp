        <p>When editing a document or micro content response, you can click <img src="../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/Interface/Buttons/Conditions-btn3.png" alt="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> on the left side of the local toolbar to open the Conditional Text dialog and set condition expressions on that file or response (i.e., include, exclude, or display by media query). This is similar to the feature that you can use to preview a document with certain conditions set<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Topics/Main-Activities/Previewing-Topics.htm">Previewing Topics</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. The difference is that this associates the conditions to the document or response <span class="EmphasisItalic">as you edit it</span>. This is not the same as <span class="EmphasisItalic">applying conditions</span> to actual content<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Process/Applying-Conditions-Content1.htm">Applying Condition Tags to Content</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Nor does this feature affect the output, as do the settings in the Target Editor<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Process/Associating-Conditions-Targets.htm">Associating Condition Tags with Targets</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Rather, this functions more like a preview feature. It simply lets you temporarily remove from view content that is associated with certain condition tags so that you can see how the file or response looks without that content.</p>

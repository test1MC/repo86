If most of the content for your outputs is similar, there is no need to rewrite it in another project. Simply specify which sections to include or exclude in which targets through the use of condition tags. This is one reason that topic-based authoring is so appealing. By placing condition tags on individual topic files themselves, you can pick and choose which topics to include in some outputs and which to include in other outputs.</p>

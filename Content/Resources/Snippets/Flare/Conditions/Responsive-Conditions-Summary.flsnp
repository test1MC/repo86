        <p>For HTML5 targets, conditions can be used to make content responsive (e.g., content changes automatically according to the size of the screen, rather than simply based on “include” or “exclude”). Associating conditions with factory media queries (Web, Tablet, Mobile) can help make some content more appropriate or easier to read on different devices.</p>

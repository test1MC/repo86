        <p>Although you have applied condition tags to content, any targets that you build will still contain all of your content (whether something has a condition tag applied to it not). To ensure that content with certain condition tags are excluded from your output, you need to associate condition tags with targets. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Process/Associating-Conditions-Targets.htm">Associating Conditions With Targets</MadCap:xref>.</p>

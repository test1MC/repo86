        <p>You can apply conditions to entire files in your project. This includes any file contained in the Project Organizer (such as glossary or target files) or the Content Explorer (such as topic, image, stylesheet, snippet, and page layout files). You can apply condition tags when you create an element (i.e., in the Add File Dialog), or after the element has been created.</p>

        <p>The following instructions are based on the task <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Process/Associating-Conditions-Targets.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Associating Conditions With Targets</MadCap:xref>, but the same principles apply to the other tasks. The only real difference is that this task affects the content that is included in the output. For example, the <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Topics/Main-Activities/Previewing-Topics.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Previewing Topics</MadCap:xref> task does not affect the output; it is merely a way to see temporarily how different condition tag settings would change a particular topic. And the <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Global-Project-Linking/Global-Project-Linking.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Global Project Linking</MadCap:xref> tasks affect which files are imported into a project, based on condition tag settings.</p>

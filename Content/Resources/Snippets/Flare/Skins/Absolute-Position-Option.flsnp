        <p>For certain styles, this can allow you to be more precise with the position of an element. This might be necessary to prevent the element from disappearing from the screen. In addition to entering values with specific units of measurement (e.g., pixels), you can enter <span class="Emphasis">auto</span> in a field. You might do this, for example, if you want the left or right property to have a particular value, but leave the other property to be adjusted automatically.</p>

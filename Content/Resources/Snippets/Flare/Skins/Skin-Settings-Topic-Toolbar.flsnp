    <body>For standard skins, there is a tab in the Skin Editor called "Topic Toolbar." The fields in that tab mirror those in the WebHelp Toolbar tab (for standard skins). As an alternative to specifying buttons in the Topic Toolbar proxy, you can specify them here in the skin. However, with standard skins, the settings in the proxy take precedence over those in the skin.</body>

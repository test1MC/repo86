        <p>Alternatively, you can use the Search Results skin component and its related proxy to design a custom container to display search results. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Proxies/Search/Creating-Search-Results.htm">Creating Search Results</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>The options in the skin component are the same as those in the Side or Top Navigation skin. Chances are good that you will never need to use a Search Results skin component, but it is available in case you want the flexibility of having another page showing search results.</p>
        <p>The Search Results skin component is not available if you are generating Tripane output. It is only available when you are producing Side Navigation, Top Navigation, or skinless output.</p>

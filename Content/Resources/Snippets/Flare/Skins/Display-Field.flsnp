        <p>You can click in the <span class="Emphasis">Display</span> field and choose one of the options (some of these options might not be available for certain styles):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">none </span>The element will not be shown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">block </span>The element will be shown and adds a line break after it. For some elements this option might be called <span class="Emphasis">flex</span>, which reflects the flexbox technology associated with it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">inline </span>The element will be shown but does not add a line break after it, allowing it to be positioned next to other elements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">inline-block </span>The element will be shown but does not add a line break after it, allowing it to be positioned next to other elements. This is similar to inline; however, with this option, a width and height can be set on the element, and top/bottom margin and padding settings are respected.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                    <h2>Installation FAQs</h2>
                    <p class="Emphasis">Can I install next to my existing version of Flare?</p>
                    <p>If it is a new version (e.g., moving from Flare 2019 r2 to 2020), yes. If it is a rev of the existing version (e.g., moving from Flare 2019 to Flare 2019 r2), no.</p>
                    <p class="Emphasis">Do I get a different key for each new version?</p>
                    <p>In most cases, it is the same key as your previous version.</p>
                    <p class="Emphasis">What happens when Flare has updates with bug fixes (not full releases)?</p>
                    <p>When you launch Flare, you will see a dialog that lets you download and install the update. If you choose not to install the update at that time, you can always go to <span class="Emphasis">Help &gt; Check for Updates</span> and install them when you're ready.</p>
                    <p class="Emphasis">I have a new version, but my co-worker is on an older version of Flare. Will we have issues?</p>
                    <p>It's possible to work like that, but it's not recommended. It is best to upgrade everything to the newest version. A user on an older version will not have access to bug fixes and newer features, so there may be some compatibility issues.</p>

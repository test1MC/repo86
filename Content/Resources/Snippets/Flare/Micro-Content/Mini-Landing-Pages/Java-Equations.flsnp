        <p class="TableText"><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> supports <a href="../../../../../Flare/Equations/Equations.htm">equations</a> written in Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) and LaTeX. After you've created an equation in a third-party editor, you can then copy and paste it into <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s editor. This gives you more flexibility to use the editor and format you want. Once you add an equation, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> uses MathJax to render it.</p>
        <p class="TableText">In order to use the Equation Editor—and in order for equations to display in the XML Editor—you need to install the latest Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or OpenJDK.</p>

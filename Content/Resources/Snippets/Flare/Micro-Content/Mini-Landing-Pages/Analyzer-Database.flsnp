        <p>An <a href="../../../../../Flare/Folders-Files/Folders-Files.htm">Analyzer folder</a> is automatically added in Windows (along with other folders) when you create a Flare project. This folder holds database files used behind the scenes when you use the <a href="../../../../../Flare/Analysis/Analysis-Reports.htm">analysis tool</a> in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. Among other types of data, this database stores information to help keep track of links between documents.</p>

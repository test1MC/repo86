        <p class="TableText">The <a href="../../../../../Flare/Step4-Developing-Targets/Output-Types/Eclipse-Output/Eclipse-Output.htm">Eclipse Help output type</a> is designed specifically for content developers who want to use Flare to author an Eclipse Help plug-in. A plug-in lets you extend the existing Help contents that come with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It  requires an additional installation of the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)&#160;and Java version. This output type is particularly useful when you want to create  dynamic, searchable content that integrates into your Eclipse environment as a platform plug-in.</p>

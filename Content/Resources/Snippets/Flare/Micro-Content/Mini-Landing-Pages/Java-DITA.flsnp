        <p class="TableText">Although there are a few tools for creating <a href="../../../../../Flare/DITA/DITA.htm">DITA</a> content, there is a big problem when you need to generate useful online and print-based output. Writers often have difficulty producing a custom look and feel for the DITA output or taking advantage of single-sourcing (e.g., generating both online and print output from the same set of files). This can result in the need for additional open tool kits or Java runtime. It can mean additional development resources to create custom transforms or other custom programming.</p>

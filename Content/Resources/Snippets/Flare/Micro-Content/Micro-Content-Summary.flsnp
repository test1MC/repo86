        <p>Micro content is short, concise information that stands alone and is easily consumable. In Flare, it begins with the creation of a collection of brief <span class="EmphasisItalic">phrases</span> and corresponding <span class="EmphasisItalic">responses</span>, such as questions and answers. After generating HTML5 output, these phrase/response combinations can be used in different ways as users interact with your output. For example, it can greatly improve the user experience when people search in your HTML5 output. It can also be used to create field-level context-sensitive Help.</p>

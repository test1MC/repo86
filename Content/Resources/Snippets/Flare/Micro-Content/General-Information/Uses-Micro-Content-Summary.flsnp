        <p>There are multiple potential uses for micro content, but some take more effort than others. As the diagram shows, there is one use—featured snippets in search results—that is quite easy to produce, and all steps can be completed in a matter of minutes in Flare. If you want to create field-level Help with micro content, you can complete all of the author-related tasks in Flare, but then you might need to have a developer make context-sensitive Help (CSH) calls in a software application. As for other possible uses, you can create the phrase/responses in Flare, but then you would also need to do additional work outside of your project (possibly with the assistance of a third-party application) in order to produce the final result. Just how much work depends on what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

        <p>To start creating micro content, you first must add a micro content file to the Content Explorer. It is recommended that you create a subfolder named "MicroContent" under the Resources folder. Then right-click on that subfolder, select <b>New &gt; Micro Content</b>, and complete the fields to create the new file. A micro content file opens in the Micro Content Editor, where you add phrases and responses. Initially, you will see one phrase/response combination, which you can replace with your own content. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Micro-Content/Process/Creating-Micro-Content.htm">Creating Micro Content</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

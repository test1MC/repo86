        <p>For each micro content phrase, you need a response, which is what the end user sees after performing a search, interacting with a chatbot, etc. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">You can enter a response directly on the right side of the Micro Content Editor, which works like a light version of the XML Editor. You can also use an existing topic or snippet (or part of it) as the response by linking to it. Another method is to select content in a topic or snippet and turn it into a micro content response. If you decide to enter content directly into the Micro Content Editor, you can use toolbar buttons for certain features. You can also use some options in the ribbons to insert other features (e.g., lists); the local toolbar simply contains buttons for some of the most frequently used features.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

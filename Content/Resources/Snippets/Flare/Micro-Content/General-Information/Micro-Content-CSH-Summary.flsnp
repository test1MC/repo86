        <p>You can set context-sensitive Help (CSH) identifiers (IDs) on micro content phrases, therefore connecting the corresponding responses to specific parts of a software interface. And since micro content is intended to be quite short, this makes it ideal for field-level Help, as opposed to say, window- or dialog-level Help. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">Flare handles the connection between your micro content phrase/response combinations and CSH IDs; however, to link these IDs to a desktop application, your programmers would need to use whatever third-party software they normally use to complete their part of the work.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

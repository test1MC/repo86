        <p>There might be times when you want to show or hide certain content depending on whether it is viewed in a regular topic in the output or when it is viewed as micro content (e.g., in search results). This is possible for linked responses by using micro content conditions. It is similar to the snippet conditions feature, but is for micro content only.</p>

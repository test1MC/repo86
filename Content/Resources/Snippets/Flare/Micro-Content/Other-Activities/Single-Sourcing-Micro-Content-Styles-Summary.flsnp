        <p>By default, micro content responses in the output look the same as the regular topic content. That's because micro content files rely on the same stylesheet(s) set at the project, target, or topic level. However, there are a couple of methods to navigate around this behavior so that you can use custom styles when content is viewed as micro content, as opposed to how it looks in the full topic. You can have a separate stylesheet for micro content responses, or you can create advanced selectors in a single stylesheet.</p>

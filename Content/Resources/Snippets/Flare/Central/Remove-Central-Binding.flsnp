        <p>If you no longer need your project to be bound to Central, you can remove its binding. Removing the binding from a project does not remove that project from Central; instead, it simply removes the link between Central and your local project. The project will still be available locally, but you will no longer be able to upload (push) changes from your local project to the cloned project on Central.</p>

        <p>If you are working in a dual-bound model (see  <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Central/General-Information/Source-Control-Central.htm#DualBound">Dual-Bound Projects</MadCap:xref>), you will author your content in Flare and then use your third-party source control tool to synchronize your files with those from other writers. After this, you can use Flare to push those changes to Central.</p>

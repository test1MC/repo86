        <p>MadCap Central's integration with MadCap Flare lets you store copies of your projects in Central, continue to work on them locally in Flare, and keep both sets of copies in sync. You can use Central to quickly build and publish output (and roll back when necessary) without the need to involve an IT department. Custom vanity URLs let you produce meaningful paths for your outputs. You can also send topics and snippets for review on Central, as well as use custom checklists to track your progress in Flare projects.</p>

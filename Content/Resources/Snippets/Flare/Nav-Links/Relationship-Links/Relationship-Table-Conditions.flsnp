        <p>Like most everything else in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can apply condition tags to the elements within a relationship table. That is why you see squares next to the elements. If you apply a condition tag to something (e.g., topic reference, group), the square will display the color associated with that condition tag. You can show or hide the condition tags if you want.</p>

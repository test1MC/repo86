        <p>Following are the collection types that you can use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Unordered (default) </span>This displays the grouped links in the output, but the order in which they are displayed is not important.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Family </span>This lets you display links not only to adjacent topics in the row, but to other topics grouped within the same cell as well.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">You have a row that is populated like this:</p>
                    <p>Topic A is in the "concept" cell.</p>
                    <p>Topics B, C, and D are contained in a group in the "task" cell.</p>
                    <p>Topic E is in the "reference" cell.</p>
                    <p>Suppose you <span class="EmphasisItalic">do not</span> use the Family collection type. In that case, when a user opens Topic A, he will see links to Topics B, C, D, and E. However, when the user opens Topic C, he will see links to Topic A and Topic E, but not to Topics B and D.</p>
                    <p>Now suppose you <span class="EmphasisItalic">do</span> use the Family collection type. In that case, when a user opens Topic C, he will see links not only to Topics A and E, but to Topics B and D as well.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Sequence </span>This displays links with significance given to how the links are ordered in the output. For <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> outputs other than DITA, this option is not supported. For more detailed information about DITA and the sequence option, please refer to:</p>

            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Choice </span>This lets you specify which link should be "selected" or "highlighted" from the group of links. For <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> outputs other than DITA, this option is not supported. For more detailed information about DITA and the choice option, please refer to:</p>

                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="CONREF:Relationship tables" />Use CONREF Target </span>This uses the conref attribute to pull content. The conref attribute references an ID on content that can be reused. For <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> outputs other than DITA, this option is not supported.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unless you leave the default link setting, collection types are identified by a green background when you set them. To identify the exact kind of group applied, you can select the item and then click the appropriate Properties button in the local toolbar.</p>
        <p>You can specify collection types on individual items in a group or on entire columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Collection Types on Items in Groups </span> Each group item in a relationship table can use a different kind of collection type.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Collection Types on Columns </span>If you apply a collection type to a column, all of the groups in that column will use that same setting (unless you later override the setting on individual groups).</li>
        </ul>

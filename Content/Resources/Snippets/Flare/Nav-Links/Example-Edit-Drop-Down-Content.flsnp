            </p>
            <p>If you want to change the text of the hotspot to "see this," you would simply replace the hotspot text between the small brackets in the topic.</p>
            <p>If you want to add another paragraph in the drop-down body, you would simply click somewhere in the drop-down body, press <span class="Emphasis">ENTER</span>, and type the additional paragraph.</p>
            <p>And if you want to edit an image in the drop-down body, you would simply edit the image just as you would if it were not contained in a drop-down (e.g., right-click the image and select <span class="Emphasis">Edit With MadCap Capture</span>.</p>

        <p>A topic toolbar displays buttons in a custom toolbar within the topic content, based on the insertion of a Topic Toolbar proxy. In addition to a Topic Toolbar proxy, you can use a skin component (for HTML5) or a Standard skin (for WebHelp and HTML Help outputs). Choosing the buttons for the toolbar can be done in the proxy, but it can also be done in the skin or skin component (proxy selections have precedence).</p>

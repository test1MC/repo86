        <p>A hotspot is the part of an element that you click to make it do something (e.g., open another topic, open a popup, expand text). For some navigation features—such as cross-references and hyperlinks—the entire element is a hotspot. For dynamic effects—drop-down text, expanding text, togglers, and popups—only part of the effect is a hotspot. For features such as this, you can use styles to change the hotspot portion of the element.</p>

One benefit of a relationship link is that you can create all of your link information in one place, in a single relationship table. Another benefit is that you can have multiple types of links at the bottom of topics (e.g., one for "Related Information," one for "Related Tasks," and one for "Reference Materials"). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Nav-Links/Relationship-Links/Relationship-Tables.htm">Relationship Tables</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Print-Only-Topics/Flare/Nav-Links/Relationship-Tables.htm">Relationship Tables and Links</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

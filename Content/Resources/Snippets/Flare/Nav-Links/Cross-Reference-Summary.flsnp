            <MadCap:snippetText src="Cross-Reference-Definition.flsnp" /> This is somewhat similar to a text hyperlink. However, cross-references differ from hyperlinks in a few ways. (1) They are based on format commands that help you keep the look of links consistent. (2) They are especially useful for print output because they let you automatically refer to specific areas and/or page numbers in the output. (3) Both the source and destination files must be part of the same target output within the same project.</p>

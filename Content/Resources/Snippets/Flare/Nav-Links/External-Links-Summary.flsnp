        <p>You can view a list of files in your Flare project containing links to external files. For example, if you have a text hyperlink to a website, the file name where the link exists is displayed. By clicking the "Check" button, you can verify that all external links point to valid destinations. <MadCap:snippetText src="../General/Double-Click-Right-Click-Open.flsnp" /> This lets you fix any problems with external links.</p>

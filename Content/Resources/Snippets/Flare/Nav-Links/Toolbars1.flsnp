        <p>There are three types of toolbars that you can add to your online output—topic, web, and eLearning. A topic toolbar displays buttons in a custom toolbar within the topic content, based on the insertion of a Topic Toolbar proxy. A web toolbar displays buttons within the skin framework. An eLearning toolbar is typically shown at the bottom of topics to guide individuals through an online eLearning course.</p>

        <p>You can view a list of the content files (e.g., topics, images, multimedia, page layouts, template pages, snippets) within your project that are not being used. For example, if an image file is added to your project but not yet inserted into any topic, it is considered an unused file. Also, if you have created a topic, but no other files link to that topic (or if no index keywords or concepts have been inserted into it), the topic is considered unused. You can quickly delete any of the files that you do not plan to use. You can also add condition tags to the content&#160;files.</p>

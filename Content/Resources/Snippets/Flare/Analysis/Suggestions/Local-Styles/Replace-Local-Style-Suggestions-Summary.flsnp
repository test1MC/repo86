        <p>You can view the places in your project where you have used local formatting. The analysis tool suggests that you replace these instances of formatting with existing styles in your stylesheet that match the formatting that you have applied manually. This is different from a new style suggestion in the following way: With a new style suggestion, the properties in the tag do not match an <i>existing</i> style exactly; therefore, the analysis suggests that you create a <i>new</i> style. On the other hand, if you make formatting changes that happen to result in an exact match to all of the properties in an <i>existing</i> style, the analysis suggests that you replace the formatting with that style (rather than creating a new style).</p>

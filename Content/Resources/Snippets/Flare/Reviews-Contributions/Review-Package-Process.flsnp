        <p>The review package process lets you send Flare files for review, as well as receive file contributions from, SMEs and other Flare authors. Non-Flare users can download a separate application called MadCap Contributor when collaborating with you and your <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. You can also use the same features to send files for review to other <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> authors using <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> only.</p>

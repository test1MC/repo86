        <p>The Central review process lets you send Flare topics and snippets to be reviewed by subject matter experts (SMEs) or other Flare authors on MadCap Central. After making edits and adding annotations (comments) to the files in the Review Editor on Central, the reviewers submit the finished files, sending them back to your inbox in Flare. You can then accept or reject their changes and accept the file, replacing the original source file.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1"> Because this system uses the cloud, SMEs do not need to download any software to review your files. Also, multiple reviewers can edit the same file at the same time.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

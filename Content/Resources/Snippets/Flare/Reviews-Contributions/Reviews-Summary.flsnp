        <p>You can share review package files containing topics and/or snippets with other individuals to get their feedback and/or changes. You can transfer the files between yourself and reviewers in various ways (e.g., email, SharePoint, external resources feature, save to a network drive). The reviewer's changes are always automatically tracked so you can see what edits were made. After inserting annotations (comments) or making changes to a file with Flare or with Contributor (for non-Flare users), reviewers can send the package back to you. You can then view those comments and accept or reject the edits so that they are added to the source file(s).</p>

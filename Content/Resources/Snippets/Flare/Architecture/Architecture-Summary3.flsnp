        <p>Along with the information about external and internal architecture, we have included explanations of how we (the MadCap Software Documentation Team) use the various features described and the methods we have adopted.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that there are best practices, or recommendations, here and there. However, there is no universal best practice for designing your architecture. What might be best for one author or writing team, but not be best for others. You need to be aware of the options available, explore the pros and cons of each, and make educated decisions.</p>

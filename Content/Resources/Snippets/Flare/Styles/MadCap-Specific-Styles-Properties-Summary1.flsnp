        <p MadCap:conditions="">In addition to the many standard styles from W3C, you might notice several unique-looking styles that begin with the word "MadCap" (e.g., MadCap|footnote, MadCap|toggler). There are also many MadCap-specific properties. You will recognize these properties because they always start with "mc" (e.g., mc-footnote-format, mc-hyphenate).</p>

        <p>One use for a medium is to have one group of style settings for online formats  and a different group of settings for print-based formats; therefore, you could use one medium for your online targets and another medium for print-based targets. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">Another example is if you need to generate multiple PDFs in different color themes; most of the styles might be the same in each PDF, but you can use mediums to separate the color and other stylistic differences.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

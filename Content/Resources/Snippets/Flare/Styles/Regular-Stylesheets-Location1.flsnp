        <p>You can have as many styles as you want within one regular stylesheet, and you can create as many stylesheets as you need (although one stylesheet is often sufficient for many authors and projects). The recommended location to store a regular <MadCap:keyword term="CSS file" />CSS stylesheet in the Content Explorer is in the Resources &gt; Stylesheets folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like.</p>

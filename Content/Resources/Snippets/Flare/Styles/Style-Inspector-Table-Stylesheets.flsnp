        <p>If you place your cursor in a table that is using a special table stylesheet, the appropriate style from the regular stylesheet is featured in the Style Inspector. Although styles and properties from the table stylesheet are also displayed, they are treated much like those from factory stylesheets. In other words, the background is gray and you cannot edit those properties. Instead, you should open the table stylesheet separately and edit its formatting within it.</p>

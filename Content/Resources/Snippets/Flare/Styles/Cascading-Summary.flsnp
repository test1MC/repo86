        <p>The appearance of your output does not come from just a single stylesheet in your Flare project. Rather, it is produced from style settings originating from other places as well. Not only that, but style settings can be set in the same stylesheet in different ways. These various settings “cascade” (combine) to give the content its final look.</p>

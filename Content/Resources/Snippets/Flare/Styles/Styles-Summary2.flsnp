        <p><MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> lets you work with stylesheets in a number of ways. You can use a primary stylesheet, automatically associating it with all files at the target level or project level (recommended). However, if you have some topics that you want to use a different stylesheet, you also have the option of associating those individual files with that other stylesheet. Once you’ve set up your stylesheet, you can apply its styles to the different pieces of content in your topics and snippets.</p>

        <p>As much as possible, you should avoid the opposite of styles, which is local formatting. For example, you can highlight some text and make it green and italic right where that content exists. But if you make that same change in many places, it takes a lot longer and it's a lot more work to control the look of that content if you later change your mind.</p>

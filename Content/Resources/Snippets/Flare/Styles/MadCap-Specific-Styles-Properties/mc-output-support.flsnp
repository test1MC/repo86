        <p class="TableTextEmphasis">mc-output-support</p>
        <p class="TableText">Lets you choose which kinds of outputs (e.g. all, all online, all print, or a specific output type) support a particular style. You typically will not need or want to change the value in this field, but there might be times when you do. For example, instead of using a skin for an index in online output, you could use an index proxy, which is primarily intended for print-based output. Therefore, you could change the mc-output-support property for the MadCap|indexProxy style from all-print to all.</p>

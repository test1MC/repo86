        <p class="TableText">Text snippets are best used for shorter snippets, such as a few sentences or words. You might add text snippets in the middle of a paragraph, in a table, or within other snippets.</p>
        <p class="TableText">Using a text snippet (as opposed to a block snippet) style  does not affect the output. If you want to make changes to a snippet that affect the output, you can open the snippet and modify it in the XML Editor, just as you would edit a regular topic.</p>

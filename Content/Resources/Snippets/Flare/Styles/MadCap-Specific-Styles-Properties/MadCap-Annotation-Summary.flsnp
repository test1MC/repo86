        <p class="TableText">Modifies the look of content to which an annotation (i.e., internal topic comment) points. For example, you might want annotated text to be displayed in the XML Editor with red font and a yellow background. This does not change the text as it will be shown in the output, but rather only as it is displayed in the XML Editor for authors. When an annotation is inserted in a content file, the MadCap:annotation tag includes the comment's creation date, user name and initials (as set in the File &gt; Options dialog, Review tab) of the person who created or edited it, and the comment text.</p>

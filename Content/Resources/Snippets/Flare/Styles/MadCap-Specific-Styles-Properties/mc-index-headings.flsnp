        <p class="TableText">This property is used with the MadCap|indexProxy style when building print-based output that includes a generated index (i.e., an Index proxy). This property specifies whether the generated index should include headings above the alphabetical groups of entries. The default setting is "True," meaning that index headings will be included. However, you can always override this setting at the spot where a particular Index proxy is inserted. If you want all index proxies to not include headings by default, you can edit this style property, setting it to "False."</p>

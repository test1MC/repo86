                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Shared/Co-Fl/Styles/Warning-Disable-Styles.flsnp" /> For example, let's say that you have inserted several images in your project. When you do this, an &lt;img&gt; tag is used. Therefore, although you may never edit the properties for the img style, you still require it in order to insert images in the future. Otherwise, features such as the option to insert images become disabled in the interface. The bottom line is that you should use caution when disabling styles, making sure that you truly will not need to use those styles.</p>

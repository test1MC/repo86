        <p>When you add a new page layout to your project, you select a page layout template as the basis for the new layout. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> lets you choose from various factory templates, each of which is useful for different circumstances. After adding a new page layout based on a template, you are free to change it in any way you see fit. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Page-Layouts/Process/Adding-Page-Layouts.htm">Adding Page Layouts</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Page-Layouts/Process/Editing-Pages.htm">Editing Pages and Frames</MadCap:xref>.</p>

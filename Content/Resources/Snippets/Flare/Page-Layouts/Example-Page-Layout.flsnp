            <p>You are creating a manual that consists of front matter (e.g., title page, copyright page, and table of contents), 10 chapters, and an index. Perhaps you want all of the pages in the manual to measure 8 inches in height and 6 inches in width. Furthermore, you might want some pages (e.g., title and copyright pages) to contain no headers or footers, while you want the other parts of the manual to contain header text and page numbers at the bottom. </p>
            <p>In a situation such as this, you might create one page layout for your title and copyright pages, a second page layout for your TOC, a third page layout to be used by all of the chapters, and a fourth page layout to be used by the index. Each page layout might contain the same page size settings, but different page headers and footers.</p>

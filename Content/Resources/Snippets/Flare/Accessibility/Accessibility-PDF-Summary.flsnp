        <p>If you need your PDF to be accessible, you can build your PDF target to generate a tagged document that is  PDF/UA compliant (i.e., Portable Document Format/Universal Accessibility).</p>
        <p>The Section 508 standard states, "In order for a PDF to be accessible, both the content and the back end structure must be free from issues that would alter or block information to users with disabilities.”</p>

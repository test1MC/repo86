        <p>PDF/UA is an ISO standard that enhances the readability of a document for people with disabilities. To meet PDF/UA compliance documents must meet certain criteria regarding the tags used within the document. A tagged PDF provides the structural representation and accessibility markup needed for use with assistive technology devices (e.g., screen magnifiers, or screen readers). Some users rely on these tags in PDF documents for reading and navigation. </p>

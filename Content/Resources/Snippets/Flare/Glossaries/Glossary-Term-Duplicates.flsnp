        <p>Duplicate terms in a glossary file are identified by red icons. Green icons represent glossary terms that are unique. Also, the number of duplicates in the glossary file is shown in the local toolbar.</p>
        <p>This feature is not case-sensitive. For example, if you have "Condition tag" and "condition tag" as terms, they are considered duplicates.</p>

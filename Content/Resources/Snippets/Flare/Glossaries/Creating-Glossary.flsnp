        <p>To produce a glossary manually for print output, you need to create a unique topic, insert a Glossary proxy into it (<b>Insert &gt; Proxy &gt; Insert Glossary Proxy</b>), and drag that topic into the table of contents (TOC) file (i.e., into the TOC Editor). You also do this  to include a glossary in online output (instead of, or in addition to, using a skin or search results to display glossary terms and definitions).</p>

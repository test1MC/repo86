        <p>When you first insert a new slideshow, the content can be edited directly in the slideshow area in the XML Editor. It's perfectly acceptable to do that. However, you might find it more useful to create snippets for all of your slide content, inserting those snippets into slides as you need them. Snippets can make it easier to find and edit slide content, especially if you create a very long slideshow with dozens of slides. If you create snippets and keep them organized in the Resources/Snippets folder for your different slideshows, you'll be able to open and edit that content much quicker. Snippets also make it possible to use one piece of content in multiple slideshows.</p>

        <p>You can open a snippet either from the Content Explorer or by right-clicking it within the slide and selecting <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span> from the context menu.</p>

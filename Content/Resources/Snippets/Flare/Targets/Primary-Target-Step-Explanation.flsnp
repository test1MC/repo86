        <p>This page of the wizard lets you select a <i>primary</i> target as you get your project off the ground. This means that—although you can use more than one target for your project—you might use one target most of the time. By selecting a primary target, you will be able to use shortcut buttons to build, view, and publish its output more quickly. Also, when you open topics in the XML Editor, they will be displayed by default with the styles and other specifications associated with the primary target. However, you can use the Layout and Medium drop-downs in the local toolbar of the XML Editor to view topics with other settings.</p>
        <p>Do not worry if you're not yet sure of the best output type for your project. No matter which output type you select now, you can always change the primary target later.</p>

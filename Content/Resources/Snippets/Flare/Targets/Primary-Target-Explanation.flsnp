            <MadCap:keyword term="Primary target" />A target is a file that generates output from your project. You want your output to look and behave in a certain way, but not all authors have the same audience or work for the same company with the same needs and the same computer networking setup. Therefore, Flare lets you choose the best type of output(s) for your needs. A target file is used for each <i>instance</i> of an output type. And you can have many targets in your project (e.g., eight targets using PDF, two targets using HTML5). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Step4-Developing-Targets/Process/Determining-Output-Type/Determining-Output-Type.htm">Determining the Output Type</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Step4-Developing-Targets/Develop-Targets.htm">Developing Targets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

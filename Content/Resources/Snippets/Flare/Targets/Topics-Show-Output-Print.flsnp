        <p>If you are creating a print-based output, only the topics included in your "outline TOC" (i.e., the TOC file in the Project Organizer) will be included in the output. In addition, you can place condition tags on outline TOC entries and use them to further separate content for different outputs (i.e., if you have other targets using that same outline TOC). </p>

        <p>Developing a target means to create it, and then give it the instructions necessary to produce the desired results.</p>
        <p>When you create a new project using one of Flare's factory templates, one or more new targets are added to your project. However, just because you are provided with one or more targets initially, this does not mean that you are limited to just that target in your project. In Flare you can add targets using any of the available formats, and you can make as many copies of an existing target that you want. For example, your project might end up containing three targets that are all based on the HTML5 output type (in addition to other targets).</p>
        <p>A target file has an .fltar extension and is stored in the Project Organizer under the Targets folder. </p>

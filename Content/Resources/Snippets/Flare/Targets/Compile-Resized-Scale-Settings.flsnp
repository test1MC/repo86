        <p>When you use <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s resizing features to scale images, you can specify whether you want <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to pre-compile the resized images. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">You can do this for the online outputs (<MadCap:snippetText src="../../Shared/Ca-Co-Fl/Output/All-Online-Output-Types.flsnp" />), as well as for <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Word" /> output. </MadCap:conditionalText>What does this mean? It means that <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> will create new copies of images wherever you have specified resizing, rather than relying on the browser to render the new size from the original. This means better quality images, but it also means more image files in the output. It is recommended that you leave the default pre-compile setting as it is (enabled). However, if you want to disable it, you can open the Target Editor, select the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced</span> tab, and select <span class="Emphasis">Generate resized copies of scaled images</span> to remove the check mark. (For <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.PDF" /> output, the resized images will always be pre-compiled, whether this option is enabled or not.)</p>

        <p>There are multiple variations, or "flavors," of Markdown. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">CommonMark </span>This is a standardized syntax of Markdown,  and Flare supports this flavor entirely. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Other Flavors </span>A variety of other Markdown implementations have been created over the years to support additional features beyond the most common HTML elements. Flare may import extra markup from those flavors, but some might not be fully supported.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to do add PDFs to a Flare project is to simply paste them into  the Content Explorer. You also might consider using the <a href="../../../../../Flare/External-Resources/External-Resources.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">External Resources</a> feature, which allows you to keep the PDFs in sync over time with the original copies if changes are made to them. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">For more about External Resources, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

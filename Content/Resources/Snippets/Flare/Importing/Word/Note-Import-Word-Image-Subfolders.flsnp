            <p class="Note-Text">If you import<MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft Word" /> Microsoft Word documents containing embedded images into a project, Flare places copies of those image files in subfolders within the Resources &gt; Images folder. This is done in order to avoid naming conflicts with embedded images from other Word documents that you might import. The subfolders are named after the Word documents being imported. </p>

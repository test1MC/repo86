        <p>This creates a connection between the original files and the files that are created as a result of the import. This is useful if you want to continue editing the content outside of Flare, instead of editing in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> recognizes when changes have been made to the source documents and reminds you to reimport the documents to ensure the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project also reflects the changes. If you use this option, a link icon <img src="../../../Images/Flare/Interface/Icons/Linked-Flag-Image-ico.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> is added to the top of a linked file in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> interface. This lets you know that you need to edit the source file, rather than editing this file. If you remove the connection to the source file, this icon no longer displays on the file. Please note that if you have bound the project to source control, the icons used for source control take precedence over the link icon.</p>

        <p>If you selected “Link Generated Files to Source Files” earlier in the wizard, you will likely make future content changes in the source files. When you make such changes, the source files need to be reimported into the project so that they can be included in the output. You have the option of reimporting the files manually. However, you can also tell <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to do this for you automatically, so that you do not have to. Select this option if you want <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> to automatically reimport  files when you attempt to build output.</p>

        <p>A header file (sometimes referred to as a "map file") is a simple text file that works in conjunction with an alias file (i.e., as you edit the alias file, the header file is populated automatically). The header file contains basic information about connecting areas of an interface to the corresponding topics or micro content in online output. Both you and the software developer need access to this file, or at least to the IDs that will be used to connect various parts of the interface to specific areas of the documentation.</p>

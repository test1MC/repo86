        <p>An alias file is used to populate a header file with the information necessary for producing context-sensitive Help (CSH). After opening an alias file, you can use the Alias Editor to create and assign identifiers (IDs) for the header file. You can use a single alias file in a project for multiple header files, or you can create a separate alias file to go with each header file.</p>

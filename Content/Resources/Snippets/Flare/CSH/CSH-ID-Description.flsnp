        <p>A CSH ID is text (i.e., name) or a number (i.e., value) that connects a particular topic or micro content response with the corresponding part of the software interface. You do not need to use both the ID&#160;name and value; one is enough. By pointing to the ID (instead of the full path of the topic or micro content), you can be assured that the link will always work in case the documentation file is later renamed or moved.</p>

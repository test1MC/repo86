This application contains a dialog called "Properties" that users open to specify settings for a particular element. In your Help project, you have written a topic to explain this Properties dialog. By creating CSH, users will be able to open that specific topic by clicking a Help button on the Properties dialog (or by pressing F1 when it is open).</p>

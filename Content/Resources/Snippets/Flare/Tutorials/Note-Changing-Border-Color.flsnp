The skin component is using the same blue color for the border that you just changed for the button hover background. We're not going to change that color in this tutorial, but if you want to change it for your own project, just expand the Border section (shown next to Background in the image above) and change it in there for each of the fields shown (Left, Right, Top, Bottom).</p>

        <p>By default, these files are not arranged like they might be in a book from beginning to end. The topics are in alphabetical order, and other files such as images or styles are stored in supporting folders. You can organize files in the Content Explorer any way you want, but organization for output happens in a table of contents (TOC).</p>

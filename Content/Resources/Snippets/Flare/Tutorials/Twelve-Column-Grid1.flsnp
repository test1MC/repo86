    <body>Flare considers the entire width of the screen displaying your output, and it divides this into 12 imaginary columns. The maximum width is 100% of the space, so 12 columns equals 100%. Half the width of the available screen space is 50%, or 6 imaginary columns. One-third of the width is 33.333%, or 4 columns. It is no more complicated than that.</body>

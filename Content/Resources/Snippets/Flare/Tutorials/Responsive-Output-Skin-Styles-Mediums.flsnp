        <p>To support responsive output, HTML5 skins come equipped with three mediums/media queries—Web, Tablet, and Mobile. Web kind of serves as both a medium and media query in Flare (controlling how skins and content look on a large screen), whereas tablet and mobile are technically both media queries, not mediums. You can use these media queries to specify different looks when necessary for the various devices people might be using to view your output.</p>

        <p>Single-sourcing is a way to manage content that provides a lot of flexibility in how you put together a project and create output. A concept that allows for this is “chunking content.” Instead of having all your content in one long document, the content exists as smaller, modular pieces to make up the whole. Each chunk of content can be reused throughout the project.</p>

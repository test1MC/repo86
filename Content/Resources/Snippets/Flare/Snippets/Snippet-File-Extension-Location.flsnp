        <p>Snippets are contained in their own files (using an <MadCap:keyword term="FLSNP file" />.flsnp file extension). You can therefore share them with other authors or use them in other projects. If you insert a snippet that is stored outside of your project, the file is copied to your project. The recommended location to store a snippet in the Content Explorer is in the Resources &gt; Snippets folder. However, you can store it anywhere in the Content Explorer that you like.</p>

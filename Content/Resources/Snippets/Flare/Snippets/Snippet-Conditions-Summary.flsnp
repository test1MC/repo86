        <p>Snippet conditions are just regular condition tags that you can apply to content within snippets and then include or exclude them at the snippet or topic level (rather than at the target level). They are especially useful when the majority of the snippet content is identical everywhere the snippet is used, but there are some small differences in some places. This lets you use one snippet for many purposes, rather than having to create multiple snippets to account for the small exceptions.</p>

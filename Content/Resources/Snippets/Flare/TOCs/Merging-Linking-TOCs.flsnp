        <p>You can merge your project with others, connecting a TOC in one project with those in another project. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on your output types. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/TOCs/Other-Activities/Merging-Projects.htm">Merging Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>You can also link multiple TOCs together. From the perspective of the end user, it will be seamless in the final output, appearing as just one TOC. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/TOCs/Process/Creating-TOCs/Linking-TOC-Entries.htm">Linking TOC Entries</MadCap:xref>.</p>

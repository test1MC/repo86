        <p>To create a table of contents (TOC) manually for print output, you need to create a unique topic and insert a TOC proxy into it. By default the print-based TOC is based on the h1 through h6 styles that you have applied to content in your topics. The generated TOC in the print output is <i>not</i> necessarily based on the structure of your "outline TOC” (i.e., the TOC file found in the Content Explorer), but the outline TOC <i>is</i> used to determine the content to be included in the print-based output.</p>

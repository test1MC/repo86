        <p>For mini-TOCs, you can use styles to adjust properties such as font family and size, indentation, word spacing, spacing above/below, and TOC width. For mini-TOCs used in print output, you can also adjust the page number alignment and leader settings (e.g., the dots between the headings and the numbers).</p>

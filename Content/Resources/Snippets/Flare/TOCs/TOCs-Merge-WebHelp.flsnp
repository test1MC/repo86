        <p>Use this merging method if you are developing HTML5, <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" />, or <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Plus" /> and you want to merge the output files from your parent project with the web output files from an external Flare project. This method is useful, for example, if another author is working on the external web project to which you are linking and you only have access to the output files (not the project files).</p>

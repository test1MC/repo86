        <p>A style called "MadCap|miniTocProxy" is used to control the look of the entire container. Other styles—such as p.MiniTOC1, p.MiniTOC2, and p.MiniTOC3—are used to control the look of individual entries in the mini-TOC. Style properties—such as margin-left, font-size, and mc-leader-indent, mc-leader-format—are used to affect the look in different ways. If you have different values set for the container than you do for an individual entry (e.g., different font families are specified), the value set for the individual entry takes precedence.</p>

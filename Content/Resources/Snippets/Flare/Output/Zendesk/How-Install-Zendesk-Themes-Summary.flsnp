        <p>When your output is published to Zendesk, a zip file is created that contains all of the styles and JavaScript files needed to support your theme in Zendesk. The easiest way to export the theme created in the Zendesk output is to drag and drop it from Windows Explorer into your Zendesk Help Center dashboard.</p>

        <p>With a publishing destination, Administrators or Team Leaders on Zendesk can copy Clean XHTML or HTML5 skinless output files to a  Zendesk Help Center dashboard. This is beneficial if you have a knowledge base or FAQ that supports any service desk tickets on your dashboard. You can publish to categories, sections, and alternate brands on a multi-brand account.</p>

        <p>When you build output from your project, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> produces the output files and places them in a folder with your project files. Publishing simply has to do with copying those output files and placing them in a location where others can access them<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">, such as on a network, a website, MadCap Central, Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>,  ServiceNow<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>, or Zendesk</MadCap:conditionalText>. Of course, you can manually copy the output files from your project folder and paste them wherever you'd like, or you can use FTP software to transfer them to a remote server. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s publishing destination feature is simply a way to do this more quickly and easily.</p>

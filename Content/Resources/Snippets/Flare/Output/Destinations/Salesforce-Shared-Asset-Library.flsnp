        <p><span class="Emphasis">Shared Asset Library </span>Publish logs are used to keep track of publishing updates, and these logs can be stored in a shared asset library in Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>. This helps multiple authors on a shared Flare project to better manage publishing. If you do not have access to a shared asset library on Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>, the publish log will be uploaded to your private library.</p>

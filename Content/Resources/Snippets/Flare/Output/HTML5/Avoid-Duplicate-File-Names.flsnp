        <p>You might decide to create a new project from<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1"> Flare's Side Navigation template</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2"> one of Flare's Top Navigation templates</MadCap:conditionalText> and then import some of the files from it to your existing project. If so, you should first make sure that you do not have files with the same name in your existing project. You probably don't want a file from the template to overwrite existing files in your project.</p>

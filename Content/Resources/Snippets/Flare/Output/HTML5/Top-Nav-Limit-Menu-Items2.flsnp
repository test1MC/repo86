        <p>When your first-level TOC items are more in number than the width of your content can handle, they wrap around to the next line.</p>

        <p>This will work, but it looks cleaner to have a single row of menu items at the top. Therefore, you should limit the number of first-level books and items in your TOC file. Also, if you keep the text for those items relatively short, you can fit more of them in a single row. We recommend keeping the number of first-level menu items to six or fewer. This may require some reorganization of your TOC file.</p>

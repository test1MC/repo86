        <p>In Flare, Side Navigation is a type of HTML5 output that can be designed to look like a modern website, where the main navigation is positioned at the left or right. It lets you use a flexible, frameless output while continuing to have a more traditional configuration that looks like the Tripane format. This kind of output is possible with the Side Navigation skin type and other related features.</p>

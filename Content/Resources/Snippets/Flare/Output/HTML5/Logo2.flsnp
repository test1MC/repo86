        <p>Whatever image you use for your logo, it is automatically set to link to the topic that you've set as the <span class="Emphasis">Startup Topic</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">General</span> tab of the Target Editor. However, you can select a different topic or even enter the URL to your company's website instead (remember to include http:// at the beginning of the path if you link to a website). This can be done on the <span class="Emphasis">Setup</span> tab of the Skin Editor.</p>

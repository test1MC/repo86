        <p>Actually, you can add features such as these in your output without adding skin components. You can do this by inserting the appropriate proxies (see step 11). The skin components are used to <span class="EmphasisItalic">create a custom look</span> for the elements, while their related proxies are used to <span class="EmphasisItalic">perform the actual generation</span> of the elements. So although adding skin components is an optional step, it is likely that you will want to do it if you decide to add navigation proxies.</p>

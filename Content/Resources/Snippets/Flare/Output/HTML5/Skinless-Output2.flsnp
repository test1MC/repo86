            <p>First, you can add various types of links throughout your content files. This might include features such as cross-references, hyperlinks, topic popups, image maps, and more. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Nav-Links/Links.htm">Links</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">For more information about using links in Flare, see the online Help or the <span class="EmphasisItalic">Navigation Links Guide</span>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
            <p>Second, you can include proxies and skin components that allow you to inject small menus, toolbars, and search bars. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Step4-Developing-Targets/Output-Types/HTML5-Output/Other-Information/HTML5-Skin-Components-Proxies1.htm">Skin Components and Proxies</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>You can also create a special topic to hold generated search results. A<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1"> Side</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2"> Top</MadCap:conditionalText> Navigation skin already includes a search bar, and you do not need to do anything else to incorporate search into your output. When an end user searches for text, Flare displays the results in its default format. However, if you want to be able to customize your own search results page, you can create a topic specifically for that purpose and insert a Search Results proxy into it (<span class="Emphasis">Insert &gt; Proxy &gt; Insert Search Results Proxy</span>). This works with the Search Results skin component that you can add to a project (see step 4).</p>

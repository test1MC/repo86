        <p>Create a Home topic. This is the first topic shown when users open the output. It is just a regular topic, but you might decide to design it to stand out from the rest of the topics. Make sure to set this topic as your startup topic. You can do this by opening the Target Editor, selecting the <span class="Emphasis">General</span> tab, and choosing the topic in the <span class="Emphasis">Startup Topic</span> field. </p>

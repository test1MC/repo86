        <p>It is not necessary to select anything in these fields, especially if you have only one type of a particular skin component (e.g., one Topic Toolbar component). But if you have more than one type of a skin component (e.g., two Topic Toolbar components), you can choose one of them as the default for all of the topics in the target. Then for the other component(s) of that same type, you can override the target setting by pointing to it in the relevant proxy (see below).</p>

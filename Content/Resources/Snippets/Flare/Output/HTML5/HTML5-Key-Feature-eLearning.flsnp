        <p>It is possible to generate HTML5 output with eLearning components for learning and development (L&amp;D) courses. You can use Flare to leverage single-sourced content from a project for creating interactive knowledge checks and gradable quizzes. It provides the capability to design courses with linear workflows, form questions, and build online output with learning management system (LMS) standards for sharing. Use the Target Editor to set output options for eLearning material. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/LMS/LMS.htm">Learning and Development</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

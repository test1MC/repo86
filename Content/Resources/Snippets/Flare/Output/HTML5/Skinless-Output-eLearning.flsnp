        <p>One common reason to create skinless output is if you are creating an online eLearning course. You might not want people to use the main skin navigation or search field, but rather guide them through the course via an eLearning toolbar that is inserted with a proxy and eLearning Toolbar skin component. This is why the eLearning project templates available in the Start New Project Wizard are already set up as skinless. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/LMS/LMS.htm">Learning and Development</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Flare/Templates/General-Information/Flare-Factory-Project-Templates.htm">Flare's Factory Project Templates</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

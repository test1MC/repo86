        <p>The Top Navigation skin uses the structure and contents of your TOC to populate the menu that appears at the top of topics. In addition, Flare's Top Navigation templates include a template page with a special Menu proxy inserted into it. This proxy creates context-sensitive menus that are displayed on the side of content, displaying links for topics that are located in the same TOC book (as well as the parent and child TOC topics).</p>

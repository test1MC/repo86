        <p>When looking at your TOC file, you might find that you have several topics that do not need to be included in it. Perhaps you decide to keep only the most important topics in the TOC, removing the others. When you generate your output, the most important items will be accessible in the top menu and context-sensitive menus (if you include them). As for the lesser topics you removed, end users can still find those by using search or from links found in other topics, which is what they will most likely do anyway.</p>

        <p>One of the benefits of Side Navigation over Top Navigation output is that the main menu is vertical rather than horizontal. This means you have more space for first-level items in your table of contents (TOC). Whereas most Top Navigation projects keep the number of first-level items in the TOC limited to around six or so, you can have far more first-level items in a TOC&#160;designed for Side Navigation.</p>

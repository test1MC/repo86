        <p>Windows 7 includes a feature called User Access Control (UAC). By default, this feature is enabled in Windows 7, which means that all users, including administrators, run programs in an under-privileged state. It is not possible to view for testing on your local computer if Windows 7 is running in this under-privileged state. If this occurs, you have two options: (1) disable UAC on the local machine, or (2) run Flare with elevated permission without globally disabling UAC.</p>

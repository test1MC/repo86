        <p><MadCap:variable name="Outputs.CleanXHTML" /> produces basic HTML files that are free of MadCap-specific tags and not dependent upon other MadCap-generated files. The output does not include any skins, search, navigation, or other extra features; it is simply your single-sourced content. This lets you re-purpose your output in many flexible ways (e.g., you can embed the output files into other applications, such as project management tools, wikis, or eLearning systems). A common use for this output format is for publishing to Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>, ServiceNow<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>, and Zendesk. You might also perform other types of post-processing tasks with the output.</p>

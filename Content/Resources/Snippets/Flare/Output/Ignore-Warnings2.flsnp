        <p>By default, Flare will use the global settings that are specified in the Options dialog. So if you want all of your projects and targets to have the same settings for ignoring warnings, it's best to just use the Options dialog. However, if you want the settings to be unique for a particular target, you can override the global settings by using the Target Editor.</p>

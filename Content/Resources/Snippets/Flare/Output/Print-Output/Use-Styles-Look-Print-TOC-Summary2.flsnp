        <p>A style called "MadCap|tocProxy" is used to control the look of the entire container. Other styles—such as p.TOC1, p.TOC2, and p.TOC3—are used to control the look of individual entries in the TOC. Style properties—such as margin-left, font-size, and mc-leader-indent, mc-leader-format—are used to affect the look in different ways.</p>

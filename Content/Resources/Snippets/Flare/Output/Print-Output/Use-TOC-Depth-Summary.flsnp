        <p>You can use the TOC depth setting to automatically change heading levels based on structure of an outline TOC (e.g., a topic with an h1 might change to an h3 in output if it is on third level of outline TOC). Not only will those headings be reflected in the generated TOC in the output, but the corresponding headings will be converted in the main body too (e.g., if a heading becomes an h2 in the TOC, it will become an h2 in the text as well).</p>

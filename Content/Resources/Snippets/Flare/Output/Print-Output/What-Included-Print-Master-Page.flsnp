        <p>A print template page uses a Body proxy as a placeholder for content in your project, as well as page header and footer proxies for page numbers. When you generate the output, a Body proxy is replaced with your topic content. Body proxies can also be used to hold information about the size, orientation, and margins for the printed pages.</p>
        <p>In addition to proxies, you can add a wide range of content to template pages, similar to the way you would add content to a regular topic. For example, you can add text or variables above or below a Body proxy to be used as header or footer content for the printed output.</p>

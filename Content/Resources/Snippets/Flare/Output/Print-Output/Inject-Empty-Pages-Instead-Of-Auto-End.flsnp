        <p>When setting chapter breaks and page layouts, empty page types are not shown in the Page Type field. If you are using empty pages in your PDF output, make sure your page layout has an empty page type and the target is set to automatically apply empty pages when necessary. To do this, open the target. On the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced</span> tab, click <span class="Emphasis">Inject empty pages as needed to ensure TOC nodes start on their selected pages</span>. This is recommended over the older "Auto-end on left page" option.</p>

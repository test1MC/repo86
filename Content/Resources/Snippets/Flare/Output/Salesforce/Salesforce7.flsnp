        <p>To publish output to Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>, you must have MadCap Connect for Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span> selected during the installation process. In a typical installation, it should already be included. If it wasn't selected during the initial process, you can modify your Flare installation via the Control Panel in Windows. In the wizard that opens, select <span class="Emphasis">Modify</span> and then enable MadCap Connect for Salesforce<span class="Registered-Trademark">®</span>.</p>

        <p>This is an easy way to merge the output from multiple <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1" /><MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp Plus" MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet2" /> Flare targets into one Help system. These targets can be originated from the same Flare project or from different Flare projects. You simply place the output files in the correct location on the server (i.e., within your parent project's AutoMerge folder). Flare then automatically merges the output from all of the targets when users access the Help. From the end user's perspective, the results are seamless, appearing as one large Help system. All of the TOCs, browse sequences, indexes, glossaries, and search capabilities for the projects are merged.</p>

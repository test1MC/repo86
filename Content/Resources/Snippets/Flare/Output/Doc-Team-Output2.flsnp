        <p>Our main “Shared” project is bound to Central. From there, we build some output and publish it on the Central server. Also, we create vanity URLs for targets, which lets us control the final URL for our output. For details, see <a href="https://help.madcapsoftware.com/central" target="_blank">help.madcapsoftware.com/central</a>.</p>

        <p>You might already have a Flare project but decide you want to use the look from a different template. For example, maybe you initially selected a template that is shown in Flare's Start New Project Wizard, but then you later find a template on the MadCap Software website that you like better. There isn't a feature dedicated to make a change like this, with built-in mapping, etc. However, you can use a combination of some Flare features to make it work. The following explains how to change templates using Flare's <a href="../../../../Flare/Global-Project-Linking/Global-Project-Linking.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">Global Project Linking</a> and <a href="../../../../Flare/Exporting/Exporting-Projects.htm" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only" MadCap:excludeAction="unbind">exporting</a> features.</p>

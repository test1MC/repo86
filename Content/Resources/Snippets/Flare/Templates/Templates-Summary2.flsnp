        <p>In most cases, <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> provides you with one or more templates (<MadCap:keyword term="Templates:factory;Factory templates" />called "factory templates"), so you do not need to worry about coming up with your own. However, if you want, you can create your own templates and use them when you create new projects or add new elements to a project. Templates can be especially useful when you are working on a team.</p>

        <p>This option exports only files affected by file tags that you tell Flare to include or exclude. This method can be especially useful for translation purposes, exporting only files that are marked with a certain file tag status (e.g., Ready for Translation). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/File-Tagging/File-Tagging.htm">About File Tagging</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

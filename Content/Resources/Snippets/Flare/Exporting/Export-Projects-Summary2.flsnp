        <p>One reason you might want to use this feature is to quickly and easily make a copy of projects and archive them, especially if you have an extremely large Flare project and need to archive only parts of it. Another use for this feature is translation. If you only need a portion of a parent project to be translated, you don't want to send the translator all of the files, but rather a smaller version of the project containing only the files requiring translation.</p>

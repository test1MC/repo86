        <p>Although <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> provides you with a user interface to work on topics (i.e., the XML Editor), you can get behind the scenes to see and edit the code for the topic. The easiest way to do this is to open the topic in the Internal Text Editor in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. To do this, open the topic as usual, then at the bottom of the XML Editor, click the <span class="Emphasis">Text Editor</span> tab. You can also use split the editor between the XML Editor and the Internal Text Editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Interface/Editors/Internal-Text-Editor.htm">Internal Text Editor</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

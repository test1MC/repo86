        <p>After an individual returns files that you have sent for review, you can bring those files into your Flare project. Once the reviewed files (i.e., topics and snippets) are inside your Flare project, you can close out the review process (if using the Central review process), then view and accept the files. After accepting a file, it overwrites the original source file in your project. Any edits or annotations (comments) in the reviewed file therefore become part of the source file.</p>

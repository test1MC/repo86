        <p>Each topic is a separate <MadCap:keyword term="XHTML:file" />XHTML file with an .htm <MadCap:keyword term="HTM" />extension. This enables you to take advantage of topic-based authoring. In other words, rather than creating a few very long documents (as you might do when working in a program such as Adobe FrameMaker or Microsoft Word), you create many small documents and then piece those separate files together to produce various outputs.</p>
        <p>Individual topic files are stored in the Content Explorer, either at the root level or in custom folders that you create.</p>

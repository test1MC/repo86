        <p>You can delete a topic any time you want. When you delete a topic, be aware of the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the topic contains any index keywords, those specific keywords will not be included in the generated index. </li>
            <li>If other topics contain hyperlinks to the topic you are deleting, you are asked if you want to keep or remove those links. However, even if you have the links removed, the text for the hyperlink remains in the other topic.</li>

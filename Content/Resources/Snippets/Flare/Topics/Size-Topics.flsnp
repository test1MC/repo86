        <p>For online output, topics are like pages on a well-designed website. They should not be too long, but should be long enough to provide useful information. There is no specific rule for determining how long to make your topics. It is mostly a matter of common sense. When you are developing a topic, ask yourself if it is something that you would find useful and easy to read.</p>
        <p>If you have a topic that seems to be getting a little long, you can break the topic into smaller topics and provide hyperlinks from one topic to another. Another solution is to use Flare's DHTML features (drop-down text and expanding text) to collapse areas of text until end users click a hotspot to open the hidden text. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">You are currently reading content contained in a drop-down hotspot.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>When it comes to creating print-based output from Flare, these small topics can be strung together in the output to form larger chapters. It is recommended that you try to use small topics when working in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />—usually no more than a few pages in output. Although you can certainly create a very long topic that holds all of the content for an entire chapter or manual, smaller topics allow you to take full advantage of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s many powerful single-sourcing features. For example, with small topics, you can reuse them when generating many different outputs, all from the same project. You might want to use some topics in some outputs, but not in others. With large documents, that is very difficult, if not impossible to do. In addition, small topics are much easier to send out to others for review.</p>

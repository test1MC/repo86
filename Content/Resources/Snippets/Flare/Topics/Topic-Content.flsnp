        <p>After you create a topic, you can add to it almost anything you want—text, tables, formatting styles, cross-references, images, multimedia, etc. It all depends on the needs of your audience. A topic can contain simple text, or it can contain a combination of many elements. A topic does not even need to contain much text at all; for example, you could simply use a topic to hold a Flash-based movie or a few lines of text for the title page in print-based output. You are only limited by what you can do with <MadCap:keyword term="XML" />XML. </p>
        <p>If you are not familiar with XML, that's okay. You can use the easy XML Editor interface to edit topics in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, working much like you would in a program such as Microsoft Word. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> creates the XML tags behind the scenes for you.</p>

        <p>It is possible to use autonumbering in online outputs, but only in a limited way. For example, if you have notes throughout your project, you can create an autonumber format on a paragraph style class that simply has the text "Note:" followed by a space. Then whenever you want to apply that style class to note content, it will automatically start with "Note:" so that you don't have to type it each time. However, in the traditional sense where autonumbering is used to increment numbers for elements such as chapters, figures, and tables, it is really only intended for print-based outputs. If you are creating both online and print output and want the autonumbering to be used only for content in the print output, you can use a print medium to specify the autonumbering settings for the print output. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Styles/Other-Features-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries/Main-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries.htm">Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Styles/Other-Features-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries/Main-Activities/Creating-Mediums.htm">Creating Mediums</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Printed-Output/Styles/Styles-Print-Output.htm">Styles for Print Output</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Styles-Guide">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Print-Only-Topics/Flare/Styles/Mediums-Media-Queries2.htm">Mediums and Media Queries</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Styles/Other-Features-Activities/Mediums-Media-Queries/Main-Activities/Creating-Mediums.htm">Creating Mediums</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

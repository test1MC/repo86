        <p>A Body proxy is also used when you create a template page for Word output. You can customize the page size, orientation, and margins for the printed pages by editing the Body proxy. If you want all of the pages in your output to share the same settings (page size, margins, etc.), you only need one Body proxy in the template page. However, if you want different pages to have different settings, you can add a Body proxy for each configuration.</p>

        <p>The Menu proxy and skin component allow users to access navigation unique to each topic, while the main navigation at the top of the page is typically limited to the first few levels of your TOC. This feature is not as common in Side Navigation or Tripane outputs, because those formats always include the full navigation on the side of topics.</p>
        <p>When you insert a Menu proxy, the Menu Proxy dialog opens.</p>

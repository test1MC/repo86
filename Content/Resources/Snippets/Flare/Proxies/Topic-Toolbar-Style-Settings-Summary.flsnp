        <p>You can control the look of the items in the topic toolbar, and the background of the topic toolbar, by opening the Styles tab of the Skin Editor and modifying the appropriate styles. By default, the background is transparent so it will show whatever is behind it in the body of the topic. When you change any of these styles, they affect settings for items in both regular web toolbars and in topic toolbars.</p>

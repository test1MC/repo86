        <p>The Previous and Next buttons in HTML5  output using Side or Top Navigation skins (or no skin) differ from those in other WebHelp and other output types (including HTML5 outputs using a Tripane skin). In WebHelp and other output types, the Previous and Next buttons navigate between topics in a browse sequence (if one is available); otherwise they navigate between topics in the table of contents.</p>

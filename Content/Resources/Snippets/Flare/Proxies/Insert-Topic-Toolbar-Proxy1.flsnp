        <p>When you insert a Topic Toolbar proxy, the Topic Toolbar Proxy dialog opens.</p>

        <p>Topic toolbars can be inserted into outputs other than HTML5. However, the Topic Toolbar skin component is supported in HTML5 only. Therefore, the Topic Toolbar Proxy dialog is split into two sections. The HTML5 Settings area pertains only to HTML5 output. The General Settings area pertains to all of the outputs that support topic toolbars, including HTML5. Anything that is set in the HTML5 Settings area overrides what is set in the General Settings area, including the buttons that are selected for the toolbar.</p>

            <p>Let's say that you want to use the default method in print-based output, where the mini-TOC entries are based on headings using the h1 through h6 styles in your project. Perhaps you have created a lengthy topic, with the h1 style applied to the first heading in that topic and several subheadings below it that are using the h2 and h3 styles. Like this:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Images/Flare/Proxies/Mini-TOC-Proxy9.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Tables-of-Contents-Guide" />
            <p>Now let's say that you insert a Mini-TOC proxy between the h1 heading and the first h2 heading, like this:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Images/Flare/Proxies/Mini-TOC-Proxy2.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>
            <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Tables-of-Contents-Guide" />
            <p>When you insert the proxy, let's say you specify that it should use a depth of 3. In that case, the output will display links that point to all your subheadings—the h2 headings (which are second-level headings), as well as the h3 headings (which are third-level headings). But suppose you also have, say, h4 headings in the topic content. Those h4 headings will not be included in the mini-TOC because you selected a depth of 3 rather than 4 or higher.</p>
            <p>In the output, it might look something like this:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Images/Flare/Proxies/Mini-TOC-Proxy3.png" class="MaxWidth90Percent" />
            </p>

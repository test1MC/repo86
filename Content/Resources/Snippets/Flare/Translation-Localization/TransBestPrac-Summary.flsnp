        <p>Preparing documentation for translation and localization might be daunting at first, but there are best practices you can implement to make the task easier, cost effective, and ready for an efficient translation. An overarching point to keep in mind  as you write, is to keep the project and content as simple as possible. If the original content is clean and of high quality, then the translation and localization will most likely be clean and of high quality.</p>

        <p>When creating a project, you can assign language attributes at different levels (i.e., project, target, topic, content). The broader the level where the language is set, the lower precedence it has. Meaning, the content level has priority over everything. The topic level outweighs the target and project levels, and the target level has priority over the project level.</p>

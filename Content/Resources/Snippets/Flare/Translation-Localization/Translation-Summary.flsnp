        <p>Translation and localization services provide the ability for us to communicate and understand each other around the world better. Translation changes the language of your content, while localization adapts content for a specific region. MadCap products (e.g., Flare, Lingo, Capture, etc.) are designed to streamline the translation process so you can easily provide multilingual documentation to your global users.</p>

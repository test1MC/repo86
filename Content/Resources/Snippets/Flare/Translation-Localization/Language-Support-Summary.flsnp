        <p>When it comes to translation and the more comprehensive process of localization (adapting language for a specific region), keep in mind that <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> supports authoring and output for left-to-right <MadCap:keyword term="Translation:LTR;LTR languages" />(LTR) as well as right-to-left <MadCap:keyword term="Translation:RTL;RTL languages" />(RTL) languages. <span class="topic-only">This includes English, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, multi-byte languages, and more. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product"></MadCap:variable> supports bi-directional languages not only at the topic level, but all the way down to the paragraph and sentence level.</span></p>

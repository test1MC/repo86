        <p>The easiest approach to getting material translated into another language is engaging <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/services/translation/">MadTranslations</a>, MadCap's full-service translation and localization division. You send your Flare project to MadTranslations, and at the end of the process you get a translated Flare project back.</p>

        <p>After you create this file, it will be stored in the Imports folder in the Project Organizer. If you want to manually reimport files from the project in the future, you can open this file (with an <MadCap:keyword term="FLIMPFL file" />.flimpfl extension). Your settings are saved in the file, and you can simply initiate a reimport.</p>

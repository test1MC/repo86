        <p>The multiple choice and multiple response question types are available to insert into a topic. They both include structure bar tags,  but they are visually distinguishable in the editor by a shape. The multiple choice type is preceded by a circle and requires one correct answer.  The multiple response type is preceded by a square and requires multiple answers for it.</p>

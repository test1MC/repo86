        <p>Flare provides technical communication capabilities for creating, managing, and delivering interactive eLearning courses. Technical writers, instructional designers, and training professionals across an organization can build a successful learning and development (L&amp;D) program while leveraging features in Flare to collaborate innovative eLearning materials.</p>
        <p class="topic-only">Because of Flare’s single-sourcing, and topic-based authoring capabilities, you can quickly assemble and organize “chunks of training,” according to course, topic, table of contents, or output. When using Flare as your eLearning authoring tool, you can create and publish content to any learning management system (LMS).</p>

        <p class="TableText">This holds files that are automatically created with each <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project. They are database files used behind the scenes when you use the analysis tool in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. You do not need to do anything with these files. However, if you are experiencing issues in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> it is sometimes useful to close your project and delete this folder in Windows. A new Analyzer folder will be created when you re-launch <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Interface/Ribbons-Toolbars-Menus/Ribbons/Analysis-Ribbon.htm">Analysis Ribbon</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

One way to edit the snippet file is to go look for it in the Content Explorer and double-click it. That method can take a lot of time if you have hundreds of snippets. Another method is to right-click on the snippet within the topic and select <span class="Emphasis">Open Snippet File</span>. But another quick method is to use the Link Viewer window pane, which not only lets you open the snippet quickly, but also see the file name of the snippet and other linked files at a glance. Therefore, you open the Link Viewer window pane. You then open the Getting Started topic. Because that topic is the file containing focus (i.e., it's the most recent file you've opened or clicked in), the Link Viewer window pane provides you with a list of all the other files linked from it.</p>

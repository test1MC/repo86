        <p>A schema is a collection of metadata that describes the elements in an XML document. <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />‘s document schema is a hybrid between XSD (XML Schema Definition) and a custom schema created by MadCap Software to account for the unique tags and styles required to support all of Flare’s features. Therefore, the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> schema conforms to industry standard requirements, recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This means <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> content can be edited in the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> XML Editor, in external editors, or transferred back and forth between the two at will. Also, because <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s code adheres to the W3C specification, it is easier to integrate with other XHTML applications.</p>

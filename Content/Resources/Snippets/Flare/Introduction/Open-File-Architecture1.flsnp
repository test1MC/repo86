        <p>All  files in a <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project are separate XML documents. This means that <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> projects are completely open, transparent, and accessible. One great benefit of this is easier customization of your project and files via scripting.</p>

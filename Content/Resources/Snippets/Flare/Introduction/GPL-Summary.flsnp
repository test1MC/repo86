        <p>By using Global Project Linking, you can import content and project files contained in another <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> project, thus allowing you to maintain the information in one location but reuse it in any other project. With this feature, you can include or exclude particular types of files (e.g., topics, snippets, stylesheets, glossaries, targets), specific individual files, or files that have certain condition tags applied. Simply use the include/exclude methods that work best for you.</p>

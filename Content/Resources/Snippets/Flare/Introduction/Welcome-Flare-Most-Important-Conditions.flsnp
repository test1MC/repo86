            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Shared/Co-D2H-Fl/Conditions/Condition-Tag-Summary.flsnp" /> For example, maybe you need to produce both online and print-based output. Much of the content you create is going to be the same for both outputs, but some of it is going to be written only for online output, and some only for print-based output. So you can create condition tags for each and use those tags to separate the content when you build your output. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Conditions/Conditions.htm">About Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, content is authored in <MadCap:keyword term="XHTML" />XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language), which is a cross between <MadCap:keyword term="XML" />XML and HTML. XML was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), intended as a replacement standard for HTML to render documents on the World Wide Web. XML is not a fixed set of elements like HTML, but rather a metalanguage (a language for describing languages). It enables authors to define their own tags.</p>
        <p>For anyone unfamiliar with XHTML, this might sound intimidating at first. But even if you do not know anything about XHTML, XML, or HTML, you can create your content in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />'s main content editor (<MadCap:keyword term="XML Editor" />the XML Editor) in much the same way you would use a tool such as Microsoft Word. The XHTML markup is automatically created for you behind the scenes. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Interface/Editors/XML-Editor/XML-Editor.htm">XML Editor</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>If you have MadCap Mimic installed, you can create videos to be displayed in the output format of your choice—<MadCap:variable name="Outputs.HTML5" />, Mimic Movie Format (MMF), Microsoft Silverlight, or Adobe Flash.</p>
        <p>After creating a Mimic movie, you can insert a link to it. The movie will open and play in the appropriate window (e.g., movies generated in MMF are viewed in the MadCap Movie Viewer). After you insert a movie link, a small movie frame icon <img src="../../../../Images/Flare/Interface/Icons/Movie-Link-ico.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> displays next to it. You can insert movie links into topics, tables of contents, or browse sequences.

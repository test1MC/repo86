        <p class="TableText">You can adjust the n-grams, which are character chunks used to separate words in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean projects. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages do not have spaces as word boundaries, so n-grams are used to separate the words. Smaller n-gram values produce smaller search database file sizes. They also lead to more search results, which may be less accurate. On the other hand, larger n-gram values produce larger search database file sizes. They also lead to fewer search results, which may be more accurate. The default size in this field is optimal for most situations.</p>

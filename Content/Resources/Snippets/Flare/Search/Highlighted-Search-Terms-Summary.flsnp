        <p>Customizing the highlight color for search hits is useful when you want to coordinate the visual elements of your online target with a color palette or scheme. It can also be used to improve the accessibility of your documentation. For example, if you are developing a project for an audience with impaired vision, you might want to customize the search highlighting to provide users with a higher color contrast.</p>
        <p>For most types of output, you can customize the highlight color using span styles (e.g., span.SearchHighlight1, span.SearchHighlight2) in a regular stylesheet. For HTML5 Tripane output, this is done in the Skin Editor instead.</p>

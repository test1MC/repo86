        <p>When users initiate a search query, the search hits (i.e., the matching keywords and phrases) may be highlighted when the individual topics are opened. This feature is called "search highlighting" and it is supported for simple text search and phrase search. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1">Note that when searching with wildcard characters, the search feature will not apply highlighting to search hits.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

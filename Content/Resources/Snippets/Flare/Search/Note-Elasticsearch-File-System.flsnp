In this case, you would be storing the copy of your output files to a local folder instead of transferring them remotely. You might choose to do this if you prefer to use a third-party tool to then move those files up to the server hosting your output.</p>
            <p>If you choose to publish your files locally in this way, you must have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 installed. See <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/java.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/java.aspx</a>.</p>

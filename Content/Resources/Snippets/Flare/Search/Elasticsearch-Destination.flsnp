        <p>Elasticsearch is tied to your target—and therefore your output—through the use of publishing destinations. You must create both a primary destination and an Elasticsearch destination. With the primary destination, you tell Flare where to send your output files. With the Elasticsearch destination, you specify where your search indexing data should be stored (i.e., the server location that is set up by your network administrator).</p>

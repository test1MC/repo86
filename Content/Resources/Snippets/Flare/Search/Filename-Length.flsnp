        <p>Because file names are part of a URL, studies show that the general rule of thumb for page URLs is that shorter URLs are better. For example, a file named "choose-a-cat.htm" would be a more compelling link for an end user to click than a file named "how-to-go-about-choosing-a-cat-or-a-kitten.htm."</p>

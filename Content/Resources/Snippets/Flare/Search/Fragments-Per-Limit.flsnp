        <p class="TableText">This sets the number of fragments that contain the text of the searched item shown in the preview text. The fragment level can be set anywhere from 0-5. This applies to both search results and Autocompletion Types. One example is if you typed in the word "Search" in the search bar. The search result extract might display like this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"<span class="Emphasis">Search</span> can be conducted from multiple locations. There are three types of <span class="Emphasis">search</span>es that can be selected in the Target Editor. Use the <span class="Emphasis">search</span> bar to locate the feature you want to use." </li>
            <li>In this case, the Fragments Per Limit level is set to 3.</li>

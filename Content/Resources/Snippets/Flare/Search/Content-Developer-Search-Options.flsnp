        <p>This table summarizes the key search features and capabilities that are available to you, the content developer, for each output type. With HTML5 and <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" /> outputs, you can distribute either client- or server-based outputs. This is why the table below lists them twice—under client- and server-based output.</p>

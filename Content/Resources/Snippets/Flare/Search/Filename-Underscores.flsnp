        <p>While it is a common practice to use underscores in file names (e.g., Choosing_a_Cat.htm), many search engine providers and SEO&#160;experts no longer recommend it because the underscore is considered by some indexes to be its own word character.&#160;While it provides visible separation between words, one point to consider is that some search engines might take regular expressions such as "Choosing_a_Cat"&#160;and interpret it as "ChoosingaCat."</p>

        <p>The Global Searches window is displayed when you click the green button labeled Global Searches anywhere in the portal. The Global Searches window shows each search criteria, the last time that criteria was searched, along with the number of times that particular search string has been searched for your Elasticsearch output. The number displayed in the Search Count field increments higher when a specific string is searched by different IP&#160;addresses. So if the same IP&#160;address has searched a certain search string multiple times, the search count number does not increment higher for that particular IP&#160;address. Each of these columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column name.</p>

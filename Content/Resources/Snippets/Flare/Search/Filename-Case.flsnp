        <p>Because some major search engine providers run indexing systems on case-sensitive servers (e.g., Apache, Unix, and Linux servers), whether a file name is written in lowercase or uppercase can make a difference as to whether the file is indexed. For example, a page named "choosing-a-cat.htm"&#160;may be interpreted differently from "Choosing-A-Cat.htm." It can also lead to search engines creating duplicate page entries, which can result in error codes when users click links, as well as penalties for content ranking. While it is difficult to predict how each and every search engine will handle a file name, it is good to pick your file naming convention wisely and then use it consistently.</p>

                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Local Toolbar </span>In the File List, select the file(s) you want to check in.

                <p>If no other users have also made changes to the file and checked it in while you were working on it, your version of the file is checked in.</p>
                <p>However, if that is not the case, the Resolve Version Conflict dialog opens to let you know that another user has already checked in the file with changes. You can merge the files automatically if there are no conflicting changes (i.e., changes do not occur in the same location in the file). If there are conflicting changes, you can use the Merge Changes dialog to determine how changes are merged.

Files that will be checked in are listed under <span class="Emphasis">Included Changes</span>, and files that will not be checked in are listed under <span class="Emphasis">Excluded Changes</span>. You can identify changed files because they say <span class="Emphasis">[edit]</span> next to the file name.</p>

        <p>When a translation suggestion is initially accepted from the MT provider, the Status field displays a 0% match. This is because Lingo is not making the direct suggestion. But if you are using a TM in your project (as recommended), and you accept a translation suggestion from the MT provider, Lingo adds the segment to your TM as a 100% match. Because some MT providers charge a fee based on the number of characters translated, this can save you money in the long run, since you will not need to retranslate the file using the MT. If you need to retranslate the file, or if you translate a file with similar segments using your TM, your TM will provide translation suggestions based on your accepted translations.</p>

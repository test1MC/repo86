        <p>If you are using MT, you can use the concordance to search any of the suggestions your MT provider has returned. After you have enabled the MT&#160;for concordance searches, you can enter any word in the concordance search window pane, and if it appears in an MT suggestion, the translation will appear in the window pane. This lets you check for consistency in your project even if you do not have a translation memory installed. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Concordance/Concordance.htm">Concordance</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h1 class="Invisible" MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">Flare What's New</h1>
        <p>Following are the new features available in this release of <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />.</p>
        <h2>Collapse Tags in XML Editor</h2>
        <p>You can now collapse tags while working in the XML editor. This allows you to collapse headings, drop-downs, div tags, and snippet blocks. </p>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Span level tags cannot be collapsed at this time in the XML editor. Expanding text blocks cannot be collapsed either.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In the XML editor you see indicators on the left edge to expand or collapse certain blocks. These blocks are expanded by default when you first open a file in the XML editor. There is a - indicator above the respective block in the structure bars area of the editor. You can collapse this block by clicking on the <span class="Emphasis">-</span> indicator.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Future">forthcoming imagexxx</p>
        <p>You have the option to hide or show the collapse and display indicators in the structure bars. Click on the <span class="Emphasis">Show Tags</span> drop-down list in the XML editor to toggle these indicators.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can have as many items collapsed or expanded on block-level tags within a topic. When block-level tags are collapsed with nested content, the nested content will also be hidden under the collapsed block-level tag.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p class="Example-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #5308be;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">xxx</p>
            <p>Example text forthcomingxxx</p>
            <p>Screenshot forthcomingxxx</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Icons Redesigned in User Interface</h2>
        <p>The interface has new icons that provide a consistent look and feel to help make Flare easier to use. The prior set of icons had a lot of detail, so the updated icons have been simplified to present a cleaner look in the user interface. These new icons are displayed on ribbons, accordion tabs, and border colors used in Flare. This look is consistent with some of the icons used currently in the Microsoft Office suite.</p>
        <p>This is an example of how the new theme displays on the Home ribbon.</p>
        <p>(placeholder imagexxx)</p>
        <p>The Help ribbon uses larger, flat style icons in place of the buttons that were previously displayed on it.</p>
        <p>(placeholder imagexxx)</p>
        <p>This style is also in place on the Quick Access toolbar.</p>
        <p>The icons have been updated throughout the user interface in Flare. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print-Only">See the Flare online Help for more information.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See Content Explorer, Project Organizer, Quick Access Toolbar, and Ribbons.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Future">(xxx add more x-refs?)</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

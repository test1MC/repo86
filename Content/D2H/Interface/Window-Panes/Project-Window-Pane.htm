        <p>The Doc-To-Help Project panel  lets you access some of Doc-To-Help's most frequently used functions .  This panel includes five window views: Documents, Contents, Index and Groups, Variables, and Related Topics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Documents </span>You can use the Documents window view to add and create new documents for your project. Documents can be converted to HTML5 format if you wish. You can also rename, remove, view and open all of the source documents that are part of the current Doc-To-Help project, and  create links to these documents. See <MadCap:xref href="Documents-Window-Pane.htm">Documents Window View (Word)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Contents </span>You can use the Contents window view to view and edit the table of contents (TOC) for the active target. You can modify the TOC if your project uses target-specific tables of contents for a specific target. You can also use this window pane to create links to the topics in your project. See <MadCap:xref href="Contents-Window-Pane.htm">Contents Window View (Word)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Index and Groups </span>Keywords and secondary keywords can be added in this view, and they can also be renamed or removed.

            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Variables </span>You can use the Variables window view to create and display all the text and rich content variables available in your project, and to create links to these variables.

            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Related Topics</span> This view lets you manage your related topics, groups, and subtopics.

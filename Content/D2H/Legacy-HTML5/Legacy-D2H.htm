        <h1>Legacy Doc-To-Help</h1>
        <p>Most Doc-To-Help authors will work exclusively in Microsoft Word when developing a Doc-To-Help project. All Doc-To-Help functionality is integrated into Microsoft Word, so there is usually no reason to go outside of Word.  </p>
        <p>However, if you have Doc-To-Help projects that use HTML5 source documents, those projects must still be managed through the Doc-To-Help program. To access the program, double-click on the Doc-To-Help application file in the following location in Windows Explorer:&#160;C:\Program Files (x86)\MadCap Software\MadCap DocToHelp <MadCap:variable name="Other.VersionNumber" />\DocToHelp.</p>

        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Topics/Topics-Summary.flsnp" />
        </p>
        <p>To create a topic, open the Content Explorer on the left side of Flare.

        <h1 class="NoPageBreakBefore">Glossaries</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Glossaries/Glossary-Summary.flsnp" />  To create a generated glossary in print output, you can let Flare auto-generate one for you (faster method), or you can create a unique topic and insert a Glossary proxy into it (more powerful and flexible method).</p>
        <p>To add a glossary file, open the Project Organizer on the left side of Flare. Right-click the <span class="Emphasis">Glossaries</span> folder and select <span class="Emphasis">Add Glossary</span>. After the glossary is created and opened, you can edit it in the Glossary Editor to the right.</p>

        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Nav-Links/Cross-Reference-Summary.flsnp" /> A cross-reference in a topic will display as a link in online output but point to a specific page in print-based output.</p>

        <h1 class="NoPageBreakBefore">Tables</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/Co-Fl/Tables/Table-Summary1.flsnp" />
        </p>
        <p>To insert a table into a content file, open the <span class="Emphasis">Table</span> ribbon and select <span class="Emphasis">Insert Table</span>.</p>
        <h1 class="NoPageBreakBefore">Tables of Contents</h1>
        <p>A table of contents (TOC) in Flare works much like a TOC in a printed book. It provides an outline of contents in your Help system so that end users can easily and quickly navigate to the information they need. You create a TOC, adding books, topic links, and links to external files in a structure that you think would be useful for the user. End users then browse through a TOC to find information. For print-based and EPUB output, you need to use the TOC Editor to create a TOC just as you would create one for online output. However, there is a fundamental difference. Performing this task for online output creates an actual TOC in the output, which people use to navigate from topic to topic. This is not the case for print-based output. Performing this task for print-based output lets you indicate which topics will be included in the output and in what order. In that sense, this TOC functions more as an outline for print-based output. Therefore, for print-based output, you can think of it as an "outline TOC." If you want to include a generated TOC in print-based output, you need to use a TOC proxy in a topic instead.</p>
        <p>To add a TOC file, open the Project Organizer on the left side of Flare. Right-click the <span class="Emphasis">TOCs</span> folder and select <span class="Emphasis">Add Table of Contents</span>. After the TOC is created and opened, you can edit it in the TOC Editor to the right.</p>
        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Variables/Variables-Summary1.flsnp" /> <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Variables/Variables-Summary2.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>To add a variable set file, open the Project Organizer on the left side of Flare. Right-click the <span class="Emphasis">Variables</span> folder and select <span class="Emphasis">Add Variable Set</span>. After the variable set is created and opened, you can edit it in the Variable Set Editor to the right, adding as many variables as you need into it.</p>
        <p>To insert a variable into a content file, open the <span class="Emphasis">Insert</span> ribbon and select <span class="Emphasis">Variable</span>.</p>

            <MadCap:concept term="FilterFeatures" />Associating Condition Tags</h1>
        <p>After applying condition tags to the appropriate elements, you can tell Mimic to include or exclude those conditions in the output. This can be done in three places—at the movie level (if it is a standalone movie), at the collection level, or on individual targets. In most cases, you will probably associate condition tags with targets, which is recommended.</p>

            <p class="Note-Text" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fdc80b;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The following instructions are for the Basic method of associating condition tags, which uses Include and Exclude check boxes. If you prefer to use the Advanced method—which uses manual AND, OR, and NOT&#160;statements—see <MadCap:xref href="#InstructionsAdvanced">Instructions for the Advanced Method</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h2>How to Associate Conditions With Targets</h2>
        <p>Targets are very useful because they allow you to generate multiple outputs simultaneously. In addition, you can create targets for either collections or standalone movies.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have not done so already, create the target(s) to be used with your collection or standalone movie. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../Targets/Targets.htm">About Targets</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../Targets/Creating-Targets.htm">Creating Targets</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li>Open the Mimic collection or standalone movie.</li>
            <li>Do one of the following, depending on whether you are working in a collection or standalone movie.<ul><li><p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Collection </span>In the Collection Editor, click the <span class="Emphasis">Targets</span> tab.</p></li><li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Standalone Movie </span>Select <span class="Emphasis">Movie &gt; Properties</span>. The Movie Properties dialog opens. Click the <span class="Emphasis">Targets</span> tab.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Select the target for which you want to set conditions and click the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button. An editing window for that target opens.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Conditional Text</span> tab. All of the available condition tags—those that you have created, as well as those from a linked Flare project—are shown on the right. An Include and Exclude check box appears next to each condition tag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you want to exclude a condition tag from the output for this target, click the <span class="Emphasis">Exclude</span> check box next to it. If you want to make sure a condition tag is included in the output for this target, click the <span class="Emphasis">Include</span> check box next to it. The primary reason for having Include check boxes is to account for possible conflicts.</p>

            <li>If you want to associate conditions for another target, repeat steps 4-7.</li>

                <p>If you want to exclude a condition tag from the output for this movie, click the <span class="Emphasis">Exclude</span> check box next to it.

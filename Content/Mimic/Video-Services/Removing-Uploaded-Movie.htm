        <p>After you upload a movie, you can remove it. Removing a video from the Video Services window pane not only removes it from Mimic, but also from the video service you are logged in to.</p>
        <h2>How to Remove a Movie</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>View &gt; Video Services</b>.</p>
                <p>The Video Services window pane opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Log on to YouTube or Vimeo. See <MadCap:xref href="Logging-In-Video-Service.htm">Logging In to a Video Service</MadCap:xref>.</p>

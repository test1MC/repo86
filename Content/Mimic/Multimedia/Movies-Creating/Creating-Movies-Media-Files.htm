        <p>In addition to creating a movie by recording your actions, you can also create a movie by selecting an existing image or video. This will create a movie with one frame that is the same size as the image or same length as the video. You can then insert additional frames into the movie and add objects, text, images, and effects to the frames.</p>

        <h2>How to Create a Movie From a Media File</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>(Optional) If you want the movie to be part of a collection, first create the collection and make sure it is open (see <MadCap:xref href="../Movie-Collections/Creating-Movie-Collection.htm">Creating a Movie Collection</MadCap:xref>). Otherwise, if you want to create a standalone movie, skip to the next step.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="Emphasis">File &gt; New</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Movie From Media File</span>.</li>
            <li>In the dialog that opens, find and double-click an image or video.</li>
            <li>
                <p>If the new movie is part of a collection, the Accept New Movie dialog opens. Enter a file name for the movie and click <span class="Emphasis">OK</span>.</p>
                <p>If you recorded a standalone movie, the Save New Mimic Movie As dialog opens. Find and select a folder to store the new movie, in the <span class="Emphasis">File name</span> field enter a name for the movie, and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</p>
                <p>The movie is loaded into Mimic.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">What's Next?</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">After you add the single-frame movie, you can enhance it in several ways (e.g., inserting additional frames, adding effects, adding objects). When you are finished enhancing the movie, you can build it. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Steps/Editing-Movie.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Editing a Movie</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../Output/Building-Movie-Output.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Building Movie Output Using the Interface</MadCap:xref>.</p>

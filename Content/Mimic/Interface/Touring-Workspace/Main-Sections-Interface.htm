        <p>The user interface consists of the following major sections.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Top </span>The top portion of the <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product"></MadCap:variable> interface displays a ribbon view, used to access features.  </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Left </span>The left side of the Mimic interface is the default location for many different window panes (e.g., Movies window pane, Palettes window pane, Help TOC window pane, Help Index window pane).  </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Middle </span>The middle section of the interface is the default location for the editors in Mimic (e.g., Frame Editor, Collection Editor, Dictionary Editor). This middle section also displays the Start Page, which is used for quickly performing high-level tasks and accessing information.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Right </span>The right side of the interface is the default location for other window panes (e.g., Frames window pane, Objects window pane, Dynamic Help).</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Bottom </span>The bottom portion of the interface is the default location for yet more window panes (e.g., Timeline window pane, Messages window pane).</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>The window panes on the right, left, and bottom of the interface are used to support the work that you do in the editors in the middle. You have the flexibility in Mimic to close or move elements around as you like, so it is not mandatory that every window or editor remain permanently in its default location.
